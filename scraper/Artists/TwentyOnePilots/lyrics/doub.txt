Doubt

Scared of my own image scared of my own immaturity
Scared of my own ceiling scared Ill die of uncertainty
Fear might be the death of me fear leads to anxiety
Dont know whats inside of me

Dont forget about me
Dont forget about me
Even when I doubt you
Im no good without you no no

Temperature is dropping temperature is dropping
Im not sure if I can see this ever stopping
Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts no
You are all that Ive got no

Dont forget about me
Dont forget about me
Even when I doubt you
Im no good without you no no no no no

Gnawing on the bishops claw our way up their system
Repeating simple phrases someone holy insisted
I want the markings made on my skin
To mean something to me again
Hope you havent left without me
Hope you havent left without me please

2x
Dont forget about me
Dont forget about me
Even when I doubt you
Im no good without you no no no no

Hey Hey
Dont forget about me no
Hey Hey
Dont forget about me no
Hey Hey
Dont forget about me no
Hey Hey
Dont forget about me no

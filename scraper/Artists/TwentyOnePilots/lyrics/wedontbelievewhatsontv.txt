We Don't Believe What's On T.V.

Yeah yeah yeah

We dont believe whats on TV
Because its what we want to see
And what we want we know we cant believe
We have all learned to kill our dreams

I need to know that when I fail youll still be here
Cause if you stick around Ill sing you pretty sounds
And well make money selling your hair

I dont care whats in your hair
I just wanna know whats on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before Im old
But because of you I might think twice

Yeah yeah yeah 2x

Alright Second verse

What if my dream does not happen
Would I just change what Ive told my friends
Dont wanna know who I would be
When I wake up from a dreamers sleep

I need to know that when I fail youll still be here
Cause if you stick around Ill sing you pretty sounds
And well make money selling your hair

But I dont care whats in your hair
I just wanna know whats on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before Im old
But because of you I might think twice

I dont care whats in your hair
I just wanna know whats on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before Im old
But because of you I might think twice

Yeah yeah yeah repeat

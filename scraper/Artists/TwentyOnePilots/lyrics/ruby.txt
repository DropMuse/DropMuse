Ruby

Ruby I hope I see you Ive waited all this week
For you to walk my way your soul will capture me
Your momma painted your room a shade of pink she said
But with your great arrival that shade has turned to red

Ruby take my hand please lead me to the Promised Land
Tell me where am I from your eyes say Shada de da dum
Ruby youre royalty in your home land they all call you Queen
Tell me where are you from your eyes say Shada de da dum

2x
Youre an angel fallen down wont you tell us of the clouds
You have fallen from the sky How high How high

Youre true and pure
You hold the cure
Were all diseased
You hold the key

Youre an angel fallen down wont you tell us of the clouds
You have fallen from the sky How high How high

Ride

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know its hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the suns peace of mind
I know its hard sometimes
Yeah I think about the end just way too much
But its fun to fantasize
On my enemies who wouldnt wish who I was
But its fun to fantasize

Oh oh Im falling so Im taking my time on my ride
Oh Im falling so Im taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

Id die for you thats easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I dont seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically Im the man
But literally I dont know what Id do
Id live for you and thats hard to do
Even harder to say when you know its not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignored them still
All these questions theyre for real
Like Who would you live for
Who would you die for
And Would you ever kill

Oh oh Im falling so Im taking my time on my ride
Oh Im falling so Im taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

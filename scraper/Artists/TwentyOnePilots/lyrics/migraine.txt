Migraine

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that Im alone

III Ive got a migraine
And my pain will range from up down and sideways
Thank God its Friday
Cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I dont know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms clouds snow and a slight drizzle
Whether its the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
Its me defending in suspense
Its me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examiner
Thats represented best by my depressing thoughts
I do not have writers block
My writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep I guess Ill sleep when Im dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that Im alone
But I know weve made it this far kid
Yeah yeah yeah

I am not as fine as I seem pardon
Me for yelling Im telling you green gardens
Are not whats growing in my psyche its a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burntdown trees
Freeze frame please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you wont forget its all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That make Pandoras Boxs contents look nonviolent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My minds shipwrecked
This is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves suicidal crazed lions
Theyre trying to eat me blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that Im alone
But I know weve made it this far kid
Ah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that
Life has a hopeful undertone

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that
Life has a hopeful undertone

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that Im alone
But I know weve made it this far kid

Weve made it this far
Weve made it this f

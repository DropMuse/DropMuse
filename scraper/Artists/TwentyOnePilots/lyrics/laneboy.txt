Lane Boy

They say Stay in your lane boy lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway highway
But will they be alive tomorrow

They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way
Wed have a tempo change every other time change
Cause our minds change on what we think is good
I wasnt raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasnt for this music I dont know how I wouldve fought this
Regardless
All these songs Im hearing are so heartless
Dont trust a perfect person and dont trust a song thats flawless
Honest
Theres a few songs on this record that feel common
Im in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin
In the industry
It seems to me
That singles on the radio are currency
My creativitys only free when Im playin shows

They say Stay in your lane boy lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway highway
But will they be alive tomorrow
Will they be alive tomorrow

Im sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat
In a gas mask
If you ask Zack
Hes my brother he likes when I rap fast
But lets back track
Back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list
But the problem is
Theres another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity
Forget salary
Forget vanity
My morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
Youre gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
All these songs Im hearing are so heartless
Dont trust a perfect person and dont trust a song thats flawless

They say Stay in your lane boy lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway highway
But will they be alive tomorrow
They say Stay in your lane boy lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway highway
But will they be alive tomorrow

Will they be alive tomorrow
Will they be alive tomorrow

They say Stay in your lane boy lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway highway
But will they be alive tomorrow
They say Stay in your lane boy lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway highway
But will they be alive tomorrow

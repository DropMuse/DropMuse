Be Concerned

Whered you go huh
They all think I know you
Its so hard to motivate
Me to devote a
Single inch of me to
Something I cant see I
Dont mean to pry but why
Would you even make the eyes
I dont believe my ears
And Im scared of my own head
I will deny you for years
Then Ill make you raise me from the dead
And if I said that I would live for you
For nothing in return
Well Im sorry Mr Gullible
But lyings all Ive learned

So be concerned 2x

No music
And I could talk about anything
Whether or not its worth while
Its based on whos listening
Most of us listen if its
Something we can relate to
All of us relate
If its something weve just been through
Take it for granted
Trust is damaged and now we panic
Living emptyhanded
Living lives like we cant manage I cant feel you
But still know where home is feeling like Jonah did
Almost dropped the bat like every base was fully loaded

So be concerned 2x

I am disappearing
Inside my birds eye theories
I try to say goodbye defy and deny
What it is Im fearing
Clearly I am dying dearly I am writing
Merely testifying that the test to fly requires I
Pass the test with colors flying
I dont believe you most the time
Im lying cause I say I am fine
You are the pearl I am the swine
So break my life and take this rhyme
Im so sorry but I do believe
That all my bridges I have burned
And Ive earned a policy of no return

So be concerned 4x

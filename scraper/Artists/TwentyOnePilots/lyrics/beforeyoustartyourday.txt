Before You Start Your Day

Open the slits in your face and start your day
You dont have much time to make your slits look just right
Im in your mind
Im singing
Im in your mind
Im singing lada lada lada lada lada lada da

Look in the mirror and ask your soul if youre alright
Put out the glitter that your soul hides behind
Youre in my mind
Im singing
Youre in my mind
Im singing lada lada lada lada lada lada da

Nowhere were they holy
Open up your eyes and see
The clouds above will hold you
The clouds above will sing

And in your mind
Youre singing lada lada lada lada lada lada da

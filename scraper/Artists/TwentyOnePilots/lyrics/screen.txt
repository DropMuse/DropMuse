Screen

I do not know why I would go
In front of you and hide my soul
Cause youre the only one who knows it
Yeah youre the only one who knows it

And I will hide behind my pride
Dont know why I think I can lie
Cause theres a screen on my chest
Yeah theres a screen on my chest

2x
Im standing in front of you
Im standing in front of you
Im trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

I cant see past my own nose Im seeing everything in slomo
Look out below crashing down to the ground just like a vertical locomotive
Thats a train Am I painting the picture thats in my brain
A train from the sky locomotive my motives are insane
My flows not great OK I conversate with people
Who know if I flow on a song Ill get no radio play
While youre doing fine theres some people and I
Who have a really tough time getting through this life
So excuse us while we sing to the sky

2x
Im standing in front of you
Im standing in front of you
Im trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

Oohoh oohohoh
Ohoohoh

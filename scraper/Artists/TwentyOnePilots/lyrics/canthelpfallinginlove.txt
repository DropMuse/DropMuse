Can't Help Falling In Love

Wise men say only fools rush in
But I cant help falling in love with you

Shall I stay Would it be a sin
If I cant help falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so we go
Some things were meant to be

Take my hand take my whole life too
Cause I cant help falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so we go
Some things were meant to be

Take my hand take my whole life too
Cause I cant help falling in love with you
Cause I cant help falling in love with you

But I cant help falling in love with you

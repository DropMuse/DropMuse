No one no one no one 
Can get in the way of what Im feelin
No one no one no one 
Can get in the way of what Im feelin 
No I wont hesitate
No more no more
This cannot wait
Im sure theres no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate 
Im yours 
All I do is win win win no matter what
got money on my mind I can never get enough
cos every time I step up in the building
everybody hands go up 
and they stay there
and they stay there 
and they stay there 
up down up down up down 
cause all I do is win win win 
and if you goin in put your hands in the air and they stay there
Nobody wanna see us together 
But it dont matter no 
Cause I got you 
Nobody wanna see us together
But it dont matter no 
Cause I got you 
Its the remix to ignition 
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin that body 
got every man in here wishin 
Sippin on coke and rum 
Im like so what Im drunk 
Its the freakin weekend baby 
Im about to have me some fun 
Do do do do do do do x3
Hey must be the money
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We threewheelin in the fo with the gold Ds 
Oh why must I feel this way hey must be the money 
If you wanna go and get high with me 
Smoke a L in the back of the Benzy 
Oh why must I feel this way hey must be the money 
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We threewheelin in the fo with the gold Ds
Oh why must I feel this way hey must be the money
Yeah yeah yeah
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We threewheelin in the fo with the gold Ds 
Oh why must I feel this way

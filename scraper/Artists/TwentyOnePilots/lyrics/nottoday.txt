Not Today

I dont know why I just feel Im better off
Staying in the same room I was born in
I look outside and see a whole world better off
Without me in it trying to transform it

You are out of my mind you arent seeing my side
You waste all this time trying to get to me
But you are out of my mind

Listen I know this ones a contradiction because of how happy it sounds
But the lyrics are so down
Its OK though because it represents wait better yet it is
Who I feel I am right now

You are out of my mind you arent seeing my side
You waste all this time trying to get to me
But you are out of my mind

Heard you say Not today
Tore the curtains down windows open now make a sound
Heard your voice Theres no choice
Tore the curtains down windows open now make a noise

Dont you test me though just because I play the piano
Doesnt mean I am not willing to take you down Im sorry

Im Im out of my mind Im not seeing things right
I waste all this time trying to run from you
But Im Im out of my mind

Heard you say Not today
Tore the curtains down windows open now make a sound
Heard your voice Theres no choice
Tore the curtains down windows open now make a noise

You are out of my mind you arent seeing my side
You waste all this time trying to get to me
But you are out of my mind

Heard you say Not today
Tore the curtains down windows open now make a sound
Heard your voice Theres no choice
Tore the curtains down windows open now make a noise

Buh buh bah buh buh bah
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah
Buh buh bah buh buh bah
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah

Buh buh bah not today not today
Bah bah bah bah bah not today bah bah bah bah bah not today no not today
Buh buh bah buh buh bah not today oh nah nah no
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

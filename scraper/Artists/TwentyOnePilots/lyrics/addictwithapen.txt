Addict With A Pen

Hello
We havent talked in quite some time
I know
I havent been the best
Of sons
Hello
Ive been traveling in
The desert of my mind
And I
Havent found a drop
Of life
I havent found a drop
Of you
I havent found a drop
I havent found a drop
Of water

Water

I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water
In the palm of my hand
Cause its all that I have
And its all that I need and
The waves of the water
Mean nothing to me
But I try my best
And all that I can to
Hold tightly onto
Whats left in my hand
But no matter how
How tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down
And the water will drain
Im just being dramatic
In fact
Im only at it again
As an addict with a pen
Whos addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and forth
Mindless spineless and pretend
Of course Ill be here again
See you tomorrow
But its the end of today
End of my ways
As a walking denial
My trial was filed as a crazy
Suicidal head case
But you specialize in dying
You hear me screaming Father
And Im lying here just crying
So wash me with your water

Water

Lovely

You say things with your mouth
Cobwebs and flies come out
I hear a second voice behind your tongue somehow
Luckily I can read your mind
Flies and cobwebs unwind
They will not take you down
They will not cast you out out

Dear friend here we are again pretending
To understand how you think your world is ending
Sending signals and red flags in waves
Its hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days
Ill pray that one day you see
The only difference between life and dying
Is one is trying thats all were going to do
So try to love me and Ill try to save you

2x
Wont you stay alive
Ill take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely

Your redemption wont grow stale
We are now just setting sail
On the seas of what we fear
Treason now is growing near to me

Im coming clean
God hit me straight on 2x

2x
Wont you stay alive
Ill take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely

New versions addition
You say things with your mouth
Cobwebs and flies come out
I hear a second voice behind your tongue somehow
Luckily I can read your mind

5x
Dont be gone

6x
You say things with your mouth
Cobwebs and flies come out

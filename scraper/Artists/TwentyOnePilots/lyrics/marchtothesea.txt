March To The Sea

Theres miles of land in front of us
And were dying with every step we take
Were dying with every breath we make
And Ill fall in line

A strangers back is all I see
Hes only a few feet in front of me
And Ill look left and right sometimes
But Ill fall in line

No one looks up anymore
Cause you might get a raindrop in your eye
And Heaven forbid they see you cry
As we fall in line

And about this time of every year
The line will go to the ocean pier
And walk right off into the sea
And then we fall asleep

And as we near the end of land
And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand
I ask myself the question
Why I fall in line

Then out of the corner of my eye
I see a spaceship in the sky
And hear a voice inside my head
Follow me instead
Follow me instead
Follow me

Then the wages of war will start
Inside my head with my counterpart
And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase
This lines the only way

And then I start down the sand
My eyes are focused on the end of land
But again the voice inside my head says
Follow me instead
Follow me instead
Follow me
Follow me instead x5

Take me up seal the door
I dont want to march here anymore
I realize that this line is dead
So Ill follow You instead

So then You put me back in my place
So I might start another day
And once again I will be
In a march to the sea

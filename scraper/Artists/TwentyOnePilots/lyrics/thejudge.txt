The Judge

Na na na na oh oh
Na na na na oh oh
Na na na na oh oh

When the leader of the bad guys sang
Something soft and soaked in pain
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway
He mustve forgot to close his door
As he cranked out those dismal chords
And his four walls declared him insane

I found my way
Right time wrong place
As I pled my case

Youre the judge oh no set me free
Youre the judge oh no set me free
I know my souls freezing
Hells hot for good reason so please take me

Na na na na oh oh
Na na na na oh oh
Na na na na oh oh

Three lights are lit but the fourth ones out
I can tell cause its a bit darker than the last nights bout
I forgot about the drought of light bulbs in this house
So I head out down a route I think is heading south

But Im not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth
Im a pro at imperfections and Im best friends with my doubt
And now that my minds out and now I hear it clear and loud
Im thinking Wow I probably shoulda stayed inside my house

I found my way
Right time wrong place
As I pled my case

Youre the judge oh no set me free
Youre the judge oh no set me free
I know my souls freezing
Hells hot for good reason so please

I dont know if this song is a surrender or a revel
I dont know if this one is about me or the devil

I dont know if this song is a surrender or a revel
I dont know if this one is about me or the devil

Youre the judge oh no set me free oh no
Youre the judge oh no set me free oh no
I know my souls freezing
Hells hot for good reason so please

Na na na na oh oh
Na na na na oh oh
Na na na na oh oh
Na na na na oh oh Youre the judge oh no set me free
Na na na na oh oh Youre the judge oh no set me free
Na na na na oh oh Youre the judge oh no set me free

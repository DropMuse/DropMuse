Forest

I dont know why I feed on emotion
Theres a stomach inside my brain
I dont wanna be heard
I want to be listened to
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name your name

I scream you scream we all scream
Cause were terrified of whats around the corner
We stay in place
Cause we dont want to lose our lives
So lets think of something better

Down in the forest
Well sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher
Well be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote

My brain has given up
White flags are hoisted
I took some food for thought
It might be poisoned
The stomach in my brain
Throws up onto the page
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name

I scream you scream we all scream
Cause were terrified of whats around the corner
We stay in place
Cause we dont wanna lose our lives
So lets think of something better

Down in the forest
Well sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher
Well be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote

Quickly moving towards a storm
Moving forward torn
Into pieces over reasons
Of what these storms are for
I dont understand why everything I adore
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes
Have you ever done that
When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then with just enough light
Comes from just the right side
And you find youre not who youre supposed to be

This is not what youre supposed to see
Please remember me I am supposed to be
King of a kingdom or swinging on a swing
Something happened to my imagination
This situations becoming dire
My tree house is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands
This is not what I had planned
This is not what I had planned

Down in the forest
Well sing a chorus
Hands held higher
Well be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote

Down in the forest
Well sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher
Well be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote

Hands held higher
Well be on fire

Hands held higher
Well be on fire

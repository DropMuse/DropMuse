TwentyOnePilots
Semi-Automatic

Night falls with gravity
The earth turns from sanity
Taking my only friend I know
He leaves a lot his name is Hope

Im never what I like
Im double sided and I just cant hide
I kind of like it when I make you cry
Cause Im twisted up Im twisted up inside

The horrors of the night melt away
Under the warm glow of survival of the day
Then we move on
My shadow grows taller along with my fears
And my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near

When the sun is climbing window sills
And the silver lining rides the hills
I will be saved for one whole day
Until the sun makes the hills its grave

Im never what I like
Im double sided and I just cant hide
I kind of like it when I make you cry
Cause Im twisted up Im twisted up inside

Im never what I like
Im double sided and I just cant hide
I kind of like it when I make you cry
Cause Im twisted up Im twisted up inside my mind

Im semiautomatic my prayers schizophrenic
But Ill live on yeah Ill live on yeah Ill live on

By the time the night wears off
The dust is down and shadows burn
I will rise and stand my ground
Waiting for the nights return

Im never what I like
Im double sided and I just cant hide
I kind of like it when I make you cry
Cause Im twisted up Im twisted up inside

Im never what I like
Im double sided and I just cant hide
I kind of like it when I make you cry
Cause Im twisted up Im twisted up inside my mind

Doo
Doo doo doodoodoo 8x

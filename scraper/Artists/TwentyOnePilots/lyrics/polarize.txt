Help me polarize help me polarize
Help me down
Those stairs is where Ill be hiding all my problems
Help me polarize help me polarize
Help me out
My friends and I weve got a lot of problems

You know where Im coming
From though I am running
To you all I feel is deny deny denial
I wanted to be a better brother better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But deny deny denial

Those stairs is where Ill be hiding all my problems
Help me polarize help me polarize

Polarize is taking your disguises
Separating them splitting them up from wrong and right
Its deciding where to die and deciding where to fight
Deny deny denial

I wanted to be a better brother better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But deny deny denial

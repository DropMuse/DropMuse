Car Radio

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know its dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
Its on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that Im driving
Theres no hiding for me
Im forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something terrifying
Cause this time theres no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And its that were all battling fear
Oh dear I dont know if we know why were here
Oh my
Too deep
Please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win
And fear will lose
Theres faith and theres sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Oooh x4

Oooh x6 amp repeats in background
And now I just sit in silence x2
And now I just sit

And now I just sit in silence x3
And now I just sit

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know its dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Glowing Eyes

We all are stranger creatures than when we all started out as kids
Culture forbids
We have romantic fantasies about what dying truly is
Fall off the grid

We live for the nights decor
It reveals what we dream of

I know theres someone at the door
They called for help of this Im sure
But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes
Im holding on to what I know
And what I know I must let go
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along

We all know somebody who knows somebody whos doing great
I know some people who know people who are flying straight
But Ill kindly enter into rooms of depression
While ceiling fans and idle hands will take my life again

We live for the nights decor
It reveals what we dream of

I know theres someone at the door
They called for help of this Im sure
But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes
Im holding on to what I know
And what I know I must let go
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along

x2
This room is far too dark for us to stay around
Redemptions not that far and darkness is going down

Im holding on to what I know
And what I know I must let go
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along
For the eyes to sing along

Make them stop x5

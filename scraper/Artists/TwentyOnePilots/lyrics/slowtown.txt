Slowtown

Hey hey wouldnt it be great great
If we could just lay down and wake up in Slowtown
Today day I want to go away way
Cause things are too fast now
I want to be in Slowtown

I put my socks on my feet
Just so that my soul wont fall through my toes
And I walk through my door
Just so I dont fall through the floor

I remember when my brother and other kids from neighboring houses
Would get together Id ride my bike and my brother would ride his
Put cards in our spokes and make our engine sound like traffic
When using Pokemon cards please do not use the holographics

So bold and fearless in the risks we take
Laugh in the face of gravity as its laws wed break
On trampolines so high we reach for the sky but I
Do not look up anymore and I dont know why

I put my socks on my feet
Just so that my soul wont fall through my toes
And I walk through my door
Just so I dont fall through the floor

3x
Were going too fast fast save us
Were going too fast fast save us
Were going too fast fast save us now

Walk through my door
Just so I dont fall through the floor

Hey hey wouldnt it be great great
If we could just lay down and wake up in Slowtown
Just singing

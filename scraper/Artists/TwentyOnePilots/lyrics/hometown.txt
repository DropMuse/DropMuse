Hometown

My shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I will let the wind go quietly
I will let the wind go quietly

Be the one be the one
To take my soul and make it undone
Be the one be the one
To take me home and show me the sun
I know I know
You can bring the fire I can bring the bones
I know I know
Youll make the fire my bones will make it grow

Where were from theres no sun
Our hometowns in the dark
Where were from were no one
Our hometowns in the dark
Our hometowns in the dark

My shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I will let the wind go quietly
I will let the wind go quietly

Put away put away
All the gods your father served today
Put away put away
Your traditions believe me when I say
We dont know we dont know
How to put back the power in our soul
We dont know we dont know
Where to find what once was in our bones

Where were from theres no sun
Our hometowns in the dark
Where were from were no one
Our hometowns in the dark
Our hometowns in the dark

My shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I will let the wind go quietly
I will let the wind go quietly

Where were from theres no sun
Our hometowns in the dark
Where were from were no one
Our hometowns in the dark

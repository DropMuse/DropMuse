Anathema

You will never know whats behind my skull
So wont you say goodnight so I can say goodbye

You will never know whats under my hair
So wont you say goodnight so I can say goodbye

You will never know whats under my skin
So wont you say goodnight so I can say goodbye

You will never know what is in my veins
So wont you say goodnight so I can say goodbye

Wont you go to someone elses dreams
Wont you go to someone elses head
Havent you taken enough from me
Wont you torture someone elses sleep

And you will never know what Im thinking of
So wont you say goodnight so I can say goodbye

And you will never understand what I believe
So wont you say goodnight so I can say goodbye

Havent you taken enough from me
Wont you torture someone elses sleep
Wont you go to someone elses dreams
Wont you go to someone elses head
Havent you taken enough from me
Wont you torture someone elses sleep

I start to part two halves of my heart in the dark and I
Dont know where I should go
And the tears and the fears begin to multiply
Taking time in a simple place
In my bed where my head rests on a pillowcase
And its said that a wars lead but I forget
That I let another day go by
I want to be afraid but it seems that these days
Im caught under water and Im falling farther
My hearts getting harder Im calling my father
Am I screaming to an empty sky
Empty sky no way thats me cause one half of my heart is free
Empty sky no way thats me cause the other half of my hearts asleep

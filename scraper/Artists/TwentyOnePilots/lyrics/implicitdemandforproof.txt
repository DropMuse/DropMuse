Implicit Demand For Proof

I know youre not a liar
And I know you could set fire
This day
Go ahead and make me look away
Strike me down
I am calling your lightning
Down from your dark hiding place
Go ahead and show me
Your face

Rain down
And destroy me
Rain down
And destroy me
Rain down

I mean no disrespect
I am simply very perplexed
By your ways
Why wont you let us
Use your name

Rain down
And destroy me
Rain down
And destroy me
Rain down
And destroy me
Rain down
And destroy me

Rain

Down

Rain

Down

Down

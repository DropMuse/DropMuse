Fairly Local

Im fairly local Ive been around
Ive seen the streets youre walking down
Im fairly local good people now

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Im evil to the core
What I shouldnt do I will
They say Im emotional
What I wanna save Ill kill
Is that who I truly am
I truly dont have a chance
Tomorrow Ill keep a beat
And repeat yesterdays dance

Yo this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
Its the few the proud and the emotional
Yo you bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but were so cold
Its the few the proud and the emotional

Im fairly local Ive been around
Ive seen the streets youre walking down
Im fairly local good people now

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 2x

Im not evil to the core
What I shouldnt do I will fight
I know Im emotional
What I wanna save I will try
I know who I truly am
I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow Ill switch the beat
To avoid yesterdays dance

Yo this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
Its the few the proud and the emotional
Yo you bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but were so cold
Its the few the proud and the emotional

Im fairly local Ive been around
Ive seen the streets youre walking down
Im fairly local good people now

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 3x

Im fairly local Ive been around
Ive seen the streets youre walking down
Im fairly local good people now

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Yeah

Im fairly local good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

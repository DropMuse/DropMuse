Time To Say Goodbye

You split
And take in every time you see
A fake and counterfeit
In the mirror you appear
To see fear
And whisper this is it
In the mirror you appear
To see nothing else
But yourself as a face
A hollowed out space
Leave me with the razor
And just in case
I fall face down on the ground
And somehow I found
Enough strength to lift my face
And make a sound
And muffled though it may be
And crazy it seems
I never felt closer to you
Just crying as you torture me

Its time to say goodbye
To the earth and now my worthless life
Cause everything Ive ever made
Is dead now
Inside the grave

Its time to say goodbye
To the earth and now my worthless life
Cause everything Ive ever made
Is dead now
Inside the grave

I just dont wanna be
So many things
And now that I see
I just wanna sing
I just wanna breathe
I just wanna fly
I just wanna close my eyes
And take in the sun
And take in the air
I just wanna run
And murder my care
I wanna believe that I will be
Free as air

Standing on a tower
Trying my hardest to make it
To you but I built this tower
Out of mortal bricks
Theyre breaking
I truly will surrender
My pretender
My disguise
And Ill truly start to
Render to your splendor
So its time to say goodbye

Its time to say goodbye
To the earth and now my worthless life
Cause everything Ive ever made
Is dead now
Inside the grave

Its time to say goodbye
To the earth and now my worthless life
Cause everything Ive ever made
Is dead now
Inside the grave

Its time to say goodbye
To the earth and now my worthless life
Cause everything Ive ever made
Is dead now
Inside the grave

Jar Of Hearts

You know I cant take one more step towards you
Cause all thats waiting is regret
And dont you know Im not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most

You learned to live halfalive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are
Runnin round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart

Youre gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So dont come back for me
Who do you think you are

I hear youre asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

Ive learned to live halfalive
Now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are
Runnin round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart

Youre gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So dont come back for me
Who do you think you are

Dear it took so long
Just to feel alright
Remember how to put back
The light in my eyes

I wish I had missed
The first time that we kissed
Cause you broke all your promises
And now youre back you dont get to get me back

And who do you think you are
Runnin round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart

Youre gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So dont come back for me
Dont come back at all

Who do you think you are
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you are

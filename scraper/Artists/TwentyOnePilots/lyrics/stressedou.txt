Stressed Out

I wish I found some better sounds no ones ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didnt have to rhyme every time I sang

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now Im insecure and I care what people think

My names Blurryface and I care what you think
My names Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good ol days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out oh
Wish we could turn back time oh to the good ol days oh
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out

Were stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come Im never able to identify where its coming from
Id make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it never sell out of it Id probably only sell one

Itd be to my brother cause we have the same nose
Same clothes homegrown a stones throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter

My names Blurryface and I care what you think
My names Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good ol days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out oh
Wish we could turn back time oh to the good ol days oh
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out

We used to play pretend give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then wed fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now theyre laughing at our face
Saying Wake up you need to make money
Yo

We used to play pretend give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then wed fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now theyre laughing at our face
Saying Wake up you need to make money
Yo

Wish we could turn back time to the good ol days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out oh
Wish we could turn back time oh to the good ol days oh
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out

Used to play pretend used to play pretend bunny
We used to play pretend wake up you need the money
Used to play pretend used to play pretend bunny
We used to play pretend wake up you need the money
We used to play pretend give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then wed fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now theyre laughing at our face
Saying Wake up you need to make money
Yo

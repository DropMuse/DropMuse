Kitchen Sink

Nobody thinks what I think
Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy
Im my own shrink
Think things are after me my catastrophe
At my kitchen sink
You dont know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you
Is not a kitchen sink to me OK friend
Are you searching for purpose
Then write something yeah it might be worthless
Then paint something then it might be wordless
Pointless curses nonsense verses
Youll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons
Meaning maybe defeating them
Could be the beginning of your meaning friend

Go away 4x
Leave me alone 7x

Nobody thinks what you think no one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game and say
They know what youre going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say
They dont know you and neither do I
So heres a prime example of a stand up guy
Who hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Heres my brother and his heads screwed up
But thats alright

Time gains momentum the moment when Im living in em
Im winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after
A rebeginning moments mending memories
Pretending enemies are frenemies sending me straight to bending me
My bad behaviour but I bet I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me and copy better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet Ill battle with em battle
Better I am gambling man better bet I am a gambling man I am

Go away 4x
Leave me alone 4x

Leave me alone
Dont leave me alone
Oh 5x

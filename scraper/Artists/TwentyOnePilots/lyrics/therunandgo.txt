TwentyOnePilots
The Run And Go

I cant take them on my own my own
Pa Im not the one you know you know
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go

Dont wanna call you in the nighttime
Dont wanna give you all my pieces
Dont wanna hand you all my trouble
Dont wanna give you all my demons
Youll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight Ill need you to stay

Dodododo dodododo

I am up against the wall the wall
Pa I hear them coming down the hall
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go

Dont wanna call you in the nighttime
Dont wanna give you all my pieces
Dont wanna hand you all my trouble
Dont wanna give you all my demons
Youll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight Ill need you to stay

Dodododo dodododo

Cold nights under siege from accusations
Cerebral thunder in oneway conversations
Oohooh oohooh oohoohooh

Dont wanna call you in the nighttime
Dont wanna give you all my pieces
Dont wanna hand you all my trouble
Dont wanna give you all my demons
Youll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight Ill need you to stay

Tonight Ill need you to stay 4x

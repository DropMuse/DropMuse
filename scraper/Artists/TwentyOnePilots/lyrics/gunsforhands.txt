Guns For Hands

I know what you think in the morning
When the sun shines on the ground
And shows what you have done
It shows where your mind has gone
And you swear to your parents
That it will never happen again
I know I know what that means I know

That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it to take it
Dont take it take it take it

Im trying Im trying to sleep
Im trying Im trying to sleep
But I cant but I cant when you all have
Guns for hands yeah

Im trying Im trying to sleep
Im trying Im trying to sleep
But I cant but I cant when you all have
Guns for hands yeah

Lets take this a second at a time
Lets take this one song this one rhyme
Together lets breathe
Together to the beat
But theres hope out the window
So thats where well go
Lets go outside and all join hands
But until then youll never understand

That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it to take it
Dont take it take it take it

Im trying Im trying to sleep
Im trying Im trying to sleep
But I cant but I cant when you all have
Guns for hands yeah

hey hey hey hey hey hey

Weve turned our hands to guns trade in our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you of my disorder or my condition
Cause when the sun sets it upsets whats left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music
Its obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist

Im trying Im trying to sleep
Im trying Im trying to sleep
But I cant but I cant when you all have
Guns for hands yeah

Im trying Im trying to sleep
Im trying Im trying to sleep
But I cant but I cant when you all have
Guns for hands yeah

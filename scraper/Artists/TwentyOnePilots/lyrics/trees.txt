Trees

I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And thats where I am
Silent in the trees
Why wont you speak
Where I happen to be
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly

I can feel your breath
I can feel my death
I want to know you
I want to see
I want to say hello

Hello Hellooho Hello

Na na na na na nah na na 4x

I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And thats where I am
Silent in the trees
Why wont you speak
Where I happen to be
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly

I can feel your breath
I can feel my death
I want to know you
I want to see
I want to say hello

Na na na na na nah na na 2x
Hello hello
Na na na na na nah na na 2x
Hello hello

Hello hello 2x

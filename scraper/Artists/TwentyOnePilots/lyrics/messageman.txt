Eh Eh Eh Eh
Eh Eh Eh Eh
No no no no no no Eh Eh Eh Eh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Eh Eh Eh Eh

A loser hides behind a mask of my disguise
And who I am today is worse than other times
You dont know what Ive done Im wanted and on the run
Im wanted and on the run
So Im taking this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present
Im obsessing all these questions
Why Im in denial that they tried the suicidal session
Please use discretion when youre messing with the message man
These lyrics arent for everyone only few understand

Eh Eh Eh Eh
Eh Eh Eh Eh
No no no no no no Eh Eh Eh Eh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Eh Eh Eh Eh

You dont know my brain the way you know my name
You dont know my heart the way you know my face
You dont know what Ive done Im wanted and on the run
Im wanted and on the run
So Im taking this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present
Im obsessing all these questions
Why Im in denial that they tried the suicidal session
Please use discretion when youre messing with the message man
These lyrics arent for everyone only few understand

My people singing
My people singing

Hope youre dead cause how could you sleep at a time like this
People they rhyme like this were all impressed by this
They rip it flip it but these are just triplets
Wrote this in three minutes three words to a line
Its just poetry divided Im the kind of guy who
Takes every moment he knows he confided in
Music to use it for others to use it
Youre dead cause how could you sleep at a time like this
Life is up here but you comment below
And the comments will always become common motivation
To promote your shows next episode
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment but you and I know it
Gets better when morning finally rears its head
Together were losers remember the future
Remember the morning is when night is dead

Release me from the present
Im obsessing all these questions
Why Im in denial that they tried the suicidal session

Fall Away

2x
I dont wanna fall fall away
I dont wanna fall fall away
Ill keep the lights on in this place
Cause I dont wanna fall fall away

I disguise
And I will lie
And I will take my precious time
As the days melt away
As I stand in line
And I die as I wait as I wait on my crime
And Ill try to delay what you make of my life
But I dont want your way
I want mine
Im dying and Im trying
But believe me Im fine
But Im lying
Im so very far from fine

And I I can feel the pull begin
Feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin
It will start to break up and fall apart

I dont wanna fall fall away
I dont wanna fall fall away
Ill keep the lights on in this place
Cause I dont wanna fall fall away

Every time I feel selfish ambition
Is taking my vision
And my crime is my sentence
Repentance is taking commission
Its taking a toll
On my soul
Im screaming submission and
I dont know if I am dying or living
Cause I will save face
For names sake
Abuse grace
Take aim to obtain a new name
And a newer place
But my name is lame
I cant walk and I aint the same
And my name became
A new destiny to the grave

And I I can feel the pull begin
Feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin
It will start to break up and fall apart

I dont wanna fall fall away
I dont wanna fall fall away
Ill keep the lights on in this place
Cause I dont wanna fall fall away

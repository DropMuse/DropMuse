Now the night is coming to an end
Ooooh

The sun will rise and we will try again
Ooooh

Stay alive stay alive for me
You will die but now your life is free

Take
Pride
In what is sure
To
Die

I will fear the night again
Ooooh
I hope Im not my only friend
Ooooh

Stay alive stay alive for me
You will die but now your life is free

Take
Pride
In what is sure
To
Die

TwentyOnePilots
A Car, A Torch, A Death

The air begins to feel a little thin
As I start the car and then I begin
To add the miles piled up behind me
I barely feel a smile deep inside me

And I begin to envy the headlights driving south
I want to crack the door so I can just fall out
But then I remember when you packed my car
You reached in the back and buckled up your heart

For me to drive away with
I began to understand
Why God died

The demon sat there waiting on her porch
It was a little dark so he held a makeshift torch
And when my car was far out of sight
He crept in her room and stayed there for the night

2x
And then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasnt made to play this game
And then I saw Him torch in hand
He laid it out what he had planned
And then I said Ill take the grave
Please just send them all my way

I began to understand
Why God died

The air begins to feel a little thin
As were waiting for the morning to begin
But for now you told me to hold this jar
And when I looked inside I saw
It held your heart

For me to walk away with
I began to understand
Why God died

Heavy Dirty Soul

Theres an infestation in my minds imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke cause Im smoking them out the basement
This is not rap this is not hiphop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rapping to prove nothing just writing to say something
Cause I wasnt the only one who wasnt rushing to sayin nothing
This doesnt mean I lost my dream
Its just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

Gangsters dont cry
Therefore therefore Im
Mr Mistyeyed therefore Im

Can you save can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
Can you save can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
For me for me uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
For me for me uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul

Nah I didnt understand a thing you said
If I didnt know better Id guess youre all already dead
Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch
Saying stuff like You only live once
Youve got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing it with me if you know what Im talking about

Gangsters dont cry
Therefore therefore Im
Mr Mistyeyed therefore Im

Can you save can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
Can you save can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
For me for me uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
For me for me uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul

Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit 2x

Can you save can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
Can you save can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
For me for me uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
For me for me uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul

Can you save can you save mysave my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
Can you save can you save mysave my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul

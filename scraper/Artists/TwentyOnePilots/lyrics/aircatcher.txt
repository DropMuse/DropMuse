Air Catcher

I dont fall slow like I used to
I fall straight down
Youve stolen my air catcher
That kept me safe and sound

My parachutes will guide me
Safely to ground
But now the cords not working
And I see you staring me down

I wont fall in
Love with falling
I will try to avoid
Those eyes

I think you would beat
The moon in a pretty contest
And the moon just happened to be
The very first thing that I missed

I was doing fine on my own
And there wasnt much I lacked
But youve stolen my air catcher
And I dont know if I want it back

I wont fall in
Love with falling
I will try to avoid
Those eyes

Cause Im not sure
I want to give you
Tools that can destroy
My heart

And I just dont say
What you want to hear
So Ill write my fears
And I dont believe
In talking just to breathe
And falling selfishly

I wont fall in
Love with falling
I will try to avoid
Those eyes

But now Im here
To give you words
As tools that can destroy
My heart

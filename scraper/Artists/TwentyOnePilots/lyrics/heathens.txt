Heathens

All my friends are heathens Take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please dont make any sudden moves
You dont know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens Take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please dont make any sudden moves
You dont know the half of the abuse

Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesnt mean our brains will change from hand grenades

Youll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
Youll never know the murderer sitting next to you
Youll think Howd I get here sitting next to you
But after all Ive said
Please dont forget

All my friends are heathens Take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please dont make any sudden moves
You dont know the half of the abuse

We dont deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions

Youll never know the freakshow sitting next to you
Youll have some weird people sitting next to you
Youll think Howd I get here sitting next to you
But after all Ive said
Please dont forget
Watch it watch it

All my friends are heathens Take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please dont make any sudden moves
You dont know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens Take it slow
Watch it
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Watch it
Please all my friends are heathens Take it slow
Watch it
Wait for them to ask you who you know

Whyd you come you knew you should have stayed
I tried to warn you just to stay away
And now theyre outside ready to bust
It looks like you might be one of us

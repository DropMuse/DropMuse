Holding On To You

Im taking over my body
Back in control no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost
Ts uncrossed and Is undotted
I fought it a lot
And it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not anymore flesh out the door
Swat

I mustve forgot you cant trust me
Im open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it Im lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it
And the story unfolds
You should take my life
You should take my soul

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my leftside brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

And Ill be holding on to you 2x

Remember the moment
You know exactly where youre going
Cause the next moment
Before you know it time is slowing
And its frozen still
And the window sill looks really nice right
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night
Right

Fight it
Take the pain ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
To a tree Tell it You belong to me
This aint a noose this is a leash
And I have news for you you must obey me

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my leftside brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

Entertain my faith 10x

4x
Lean with it rock with it
When we gonna stop with it
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It aint the speakers that bump hearts
Its our hearts that make the beat

And Ill be holding on to you 8x

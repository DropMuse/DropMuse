Ode To Sleep

I wake up fine and dandy but then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up up up up up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving like an old mans hair receding
Im pleading please oh please on my knees repeatedly asking
Why its got to be like this Is this living free
I dont want to be the one be the one who has the suns blood on my hands
Ill tell the moon take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen I see a harpoon

Ill stay awake
Cause the darks not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning
I dont hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone they told me I was gone

But Ill tell them
Why wont you let me go
Do I threaten all your plans
Im insignificant
Please tell them you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire what have I become
Ill tell them

On the eve of a day thats forgotten and fake
And the trees they await and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we dont need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes cause were told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling theres something we need
Im not free I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied I threetime mvped this crime
Im afraid to tell you who I adore wont tell you who Im singing towards
Metaphorically Im a whore and thats denial number four

Ill stay awake
Cause the darks not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning
I dont hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone they told me I was gone

But Ill tell them
Why wont you let me go
Do I threaten all your plans
Im insignificant
Please tell them you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire what have I become
Ill tell them you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become
Ill tell them
Ill tell them
Ill tell them
Ill tell them

Please tell them you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire what have I become
Im sorry

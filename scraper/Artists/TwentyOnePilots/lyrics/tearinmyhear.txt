Tear In My Heart

안녕하세요 Annyŏnghaseyo

Sometimes youve got to bleed to know
That youre alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around to show you how

Shes the tear in my heart Im alive
Shes the tear in my heart Im on fire
Shes the tear in my heart Take me higher
Than Ive ever been

The songs on the radio are ok
But my taste in music is your face
And it takes a song to come around to show you how

Shes the tear in my heart Im alive
Shes the tear in my heart Im on fire
Shes the tear in my heart Take me higher
Than Ive ever been

Than Ive ever been
Than Ive ever been
Than Ive ever been

You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But thats ok Ill just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
Im driving here I sit cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement

My heart is my armor
Shes the tear in my heart shes a carver
Shes a butcher with a smile cut me farther
Than Ive ever been

Than Ive ever been
Than Ive ever been
Than Ive ever been

My heart is my armor
Shes the tear in my heart shes a carver

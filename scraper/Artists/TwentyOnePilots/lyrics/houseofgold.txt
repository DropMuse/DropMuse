House Of Gold

She asked me Son when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me

She asked me Son when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me

I will make you queen of everything you see
Ill put you on the map
Ill cure you of disease

Lets say we up and left this town
And turned our future upside down
Well make pretend that you and me
Lived ever after happily

She asked me Son when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me

I will make you queen of everything you see
Ill put you on the map
Ill cure you of disease

Ohhhh
And since we know that dreams are dead
And life turns plans up on their head
I will plan to be a bum
So I just might become someone

She asked me Son when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me

I will make you queen of everything you see
Ill put you on the map
Ill cure you of disease

Fake You Out

I want to drive away
In the night headlights call my name

I Ill never be be what you see inside
You say Im not alone but I am petrified
You say that you are close is close the closest star
You just feel twice as far you just feel twice as far

And Ill fall
And Ill break
And Ill fake
All I wanna

And Ill fall down
And Ill break down
And Ill fake you out
All I wanna

Im so afraid
Of what you have to say
Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space

Ill never be be what you see inside
You say Im not alone but I am petrified
You say that you are close is close the closest star
You just feel twice as far you just feel twice as far

And Ill fall
And Ill break
And Ill fake
All I wanna

And Ill fall down
And Ill break down
And Ill fake you out
All I wanna

Its the same game today as it always is
I dont give these places fake my name explaining this
And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines
That remind me of all the times
I have committed
Dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly formfitted
To what Ive done and what Im doing
Im brewing and losing and spewing infusing
And believe me thats what all the kids are doing
What kids are doing are killing themselves
They feel they have no control of their prisoners cell
And if youre one of them then youre one of me
And you would do almost anything just to feel free
Am I right Of course I am
Convince me otherwise would take all night
Before you walk away theres one more thing I want to say
Our brains are sick but thats okay

And Ill fall
And Ill break
And Ill fake
All I wanna

All I wanna
Yeah and Ill fall down
And Ill break down
And Ill fake you out
All I wanna
Yeah and Ill fall down
And Ill break down
And Ill fake you out
All I wanna

Im so afraid
Of what you have to say
Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space

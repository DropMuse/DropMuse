Friend, Please

I feel for you but when did you believe you were alone
You say that spiders crawled inside and made themselves a home
Where light once was

Petrified of who you are and who you have become
You will hide from everyone denying you need someone
To exterminate your bones

Friend please remove your hands from
Over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave but
Friend please dont take your life away from me

Living like a ghost you walk by everyone you know
You say that youre fine but you have lost your sway and glow
So I stopped by to let you know

Friend please remove your hands from
Over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave but
Friend please dont take your life away from me

Would you let me know your plans tonight
Cause I just wont let go til we both see the light
And I have nothing else left to say
But I will listen to you all day yes I will

Friend please remove your hands from
Over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave but
Friend please dont take your life away from me

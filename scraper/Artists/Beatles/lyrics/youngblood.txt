Beatles
Young Blood

I saw her standing on the corner Yip yip boom
A yellow ribbon in her hair Yip yip boom
I couldnt stop myself from calling
Well look athere look athere
Wow look athere well look athere
Young blood young blood young blood
I cant get you out of my mind

I took one look and I was fractured Yip yip boom
I tried to walk but I was lame Yip yip boom
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
Well whats your name whats your name
Well whats your name well whats your name
Young blood ah young blood young blood
I cant get you out of my mind

A crazy stop she was the top
I tried to follow her all the way home
Things went bad I met her dad
He said Youd better leave my daughter alone
Ow

Well I tried to speak but I just stuttered Yip yip boom
I saw the rising of the sun Yip yip boom
And all along my heart was falling
While youre the one youre the one
While youre the one ah youre the one
Young blood oh young blood yeah young blood
I cant get you out of my mind
Yeah young blood oh young blood yeah young blood
I cant get you out of my mind

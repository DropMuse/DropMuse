Strawberry Fields Forever

Let me take you down cause Im going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesnt matter much to me
Let me take you down cause Im going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right
That is I think its not too bad
Let me take you down cause Im going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Always no sometimes think its me
But you know I know when its a dream
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Let me take you down cause Im going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

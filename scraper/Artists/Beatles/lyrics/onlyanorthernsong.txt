Beatles
Only A Northern Song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not
He just wrote it like that

When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song

It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct
Theres nobody there

And I told you theres no one there

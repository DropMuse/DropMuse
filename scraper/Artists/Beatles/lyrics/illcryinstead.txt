I'll Cry Instead

Ive got every reason on earth to be mad
Cos Ive just lost the only girl I had
And if I could get my way
Id get myself locked up today
But I cant so I cry instead

Ive got a chip on my shoulder thats bigger than my feet
I cant talk to people that I meet
And if I could see you now
Id try to make you sad somehow
But I cant so I cry instead

Dont want to cry when theres people there
I get shy when they start to stare
Im gonna hide myself away ay hay
But Ill come back again someday

And when I do youd better hide all the girls
Im gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes Im gonna break them in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then Ill cry instead

Dont want to cry when theres people there
I get shy when they start to stare
Im gonna hide myself away ay hay
But Ill come back again someday

And when I do youd better hide all the girls
Cos Im gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes Im gonna break them in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then Ill cry instead

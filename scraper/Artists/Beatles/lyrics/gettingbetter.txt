Getting Better

Its getting better all the time

I used to get mad at my school No I cant complain
The teachers who taught me werent cool No I cant complain
Youre holding me down Oh turning me round Oh
Filling me up with your rules Foolish rules

Ive got to admit its getting better Better
A little better all the time It cant get more worse
I have to admit its getting better Better
Its getting better since youve been mine

Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can

Ive got to admit its getting better Better
A little better all the time It cant get more worse
I have to admit its getting better Better
Its getting better since youve been mine
Getting so much better all the time
Its getting better all the time
Better better better
Its getting better all the time
Better better better

I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can Ooh

I admit its getting better Better
A little better all the time It cant get more worse
Yes I admit its getting better Better
Its getting better since youve been mine
Getting so much better all the time
Its getting better all the time
Better better better
Its getting better all the time
Better better better
Getting so much better all the time

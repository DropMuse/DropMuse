In Spite Of All The Danger

In spite of all the danger
In spite of all that may be
Ill do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If youll be true to me

In spite of all the heartache
That you may cause me
Ill do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If youll be true to me

Ill look after you
Like Ive never done before
Ill keep all the others
From knocking at your door

In spite of all the danger
In spite of all that may be
Ill do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If youll be true to me

Yeah

In spite of all the heartache
That you may cause me
Ill do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If youll be true to me
Ill do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If youll be true to me

I'm So Tired

Im so tired I havent slept a wink
Im so tired my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No no no

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep I cant stop my brain
You know its three weeks Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
For a little peace of mind

Im so tired Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep I cant stop my brain
You know its three weeks Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
For a little peace of mind
Id give you everything Ive got
For a little peace of mind
Id give you everything Ive got
For a little peace of mind

Monsieur Monsieur Monsieur how about another one

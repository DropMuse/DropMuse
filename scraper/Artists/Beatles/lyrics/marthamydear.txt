Martha My Dear

Martha my dear though I spend my days in conversation
Please
Remember me Martha my love
Dont forget me Martha my dear

Hold your head up you silly girl look what youve done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

Take a good look around you
Take a good look youre bound to see
That you and me were meant to be for each other
Silly girl

Hold your hand out you silly girl see what youve done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

Martha my dear you have always been my inspiration
Please
Be good to me Martha my love
Dont forget me Martha my dear

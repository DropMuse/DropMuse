Savoy Truffle

Creme tangerine and montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert yes you know its good news
But youll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Cool cherry cream nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time were apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues
But youll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
Youre going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
Youll shout aloud

InstrumentalSolo

But youll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now turns so sour
We all know obladiblada
But can you show me where you are

Creme tangerine and montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert yes you know its good news
But youll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Yes youll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

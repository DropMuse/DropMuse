Old Brown Shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe baby Im in love with you
Im so glad you came here it wont be the same now Im telling you

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo baby Im in love with you
Im so glad you came here it wont be the same now when Im with you

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows baby you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect my love is something you cant reject
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows baby you may comfort me

I want that love of yours to miss that love is something Id hate
Ill make an early start Im making sure that Im not late
For you sweet top lip Im in the queue baby Im in love with you
Im so glad you came here it wont be the same now when Im with you
Im so glad you came here it wont be the same now when Im with you

Dear Sir or Madam will you read my book
It took me years to write will you take a look
Its based on a novel by a man named Lear
And I need a job so I want to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer

Its the dirty story of a dirty man
And his clinging wife doesnt understand
His son is working for the Daily Mail
Its a steady job but he wants to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer

Paperback writer

Its a thousand pages give or take a few
Ill be writing more in a week or two
I can make it longer if you like the style
I can change it round and I want to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer

If you really like it you can have the rights
It could make a million for you overnight
If you must return it you can send it here
But I need a break and I want to be a paperback writer

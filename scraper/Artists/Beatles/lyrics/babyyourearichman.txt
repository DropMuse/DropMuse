Baby, You're A Rich Man

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be
And have you travelled very far
Far as the eyes can see

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
How often have you been there
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there
Nothing that doesnt show
Baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man too

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that youve found another key
What are you going to play
Baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man too
Baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man
Baby baby youre a rich man too fade out

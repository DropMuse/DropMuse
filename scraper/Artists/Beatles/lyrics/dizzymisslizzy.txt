Beatles
Dizzy Miss Lizzy

You make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
The way you rock and roll
You make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
When we do the stroll
Come on Miss Lizzy
Love me before I grow too old

Come on give me fever
Put your little hand in mine
You make me dizzy dizzy Lizzy
Oh girl you look so fine
Just arocking and arolling
Girl I said I wish you were mine

You make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
When you call my name
Oooooh baby
Say youre driving me insane
Cmon cmon cmon cmon baby
I want to be your lover man

Run and tell your mama
I want you to be my bride
Run and tell your brother
Baby dont run and hide
You make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
Girl I want to marry you

Come on give me fever
Put your little hand in mine girl
You make me dizzy dizzy Lizzy
Girl you look so fine
Youre just arocking and arolling
Oh I said I wish you were mine

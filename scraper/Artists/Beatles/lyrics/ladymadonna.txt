Beatles
Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was Heaven sent
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didnt come
Thursday night your stocking needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

There's A Place

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And its my mind
And theres no time when Im alone

I think of you
And things you do
Go round my head
The things you said
Like I love only you

In my mind theres no sorrow
Dont you know that its so
Therell be no sad tomorrow
Dont you know that its so

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And its my mind
And theres no time when Im alone

Theres a place

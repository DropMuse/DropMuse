Keep Your Hands Off My Baby

Weve been friends for oh so long
I let you share whats mine
When you mess with the girl I love
Its time to draw the line

Keep your hands Keep your hands off my baby
Aint I gonna tell you but one more time
Who keep your hands Keep your hands off my baby
Boy you get it through your head
That girl is mine

I dont mind if you lend my clothes
But you will be in touch
There is somethin that you get straight
Theres one thing you dont touch

Keep your hands Keep your hands off my baby
Aint I gonna tell you but a one more time
Who keep your hands Keep your hands off my baby
Can you get it through your head
That girl is mine
Ow baby

Keep your hands Keep your hands off my baby
Aint I gonna tell you but a one more time
Who keep your hands Keep your hands off my baby
Can you get it through your head
That girl is mine

Keep your hands Who keep your hands off my baby
Shes mine Keep your hands off my baby
You better watch yourself now
Boy you get it through your head
That girl is mine

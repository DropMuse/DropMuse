Ticket To Ride

I think Im gonna be sad
I think its today yeah
The girl thats driving me mad
Is going away

Shes got a ticket to ride
Shes got a ticket to ride
Shes got a ticket to ride
But she dont care

She said that living with me
Is bringing her down yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around

Shes got a ticket to ride
Shes got a ticket to ride
Shes got a ticket to ride
But she dont care

I dont know why shes riding so high
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me

I think Im gonna be sad
I think its today yeah
The girl thats driving me mad
Is going away yeah

Oh shes got a ticket to ride
Shes got a ticket to ride
Shes got a ticket to ride
But she dont care

I dont know why shes riding so high
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me

She said that living with me
Is bringing her down yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around

Ah shes got a ticket to ride
Shes got a ticket to ride
Shes got a ticket to ride
But she dont care

My baby dont care my baby dont care
My baby dont care my baby dont care
My baby dont care my baby dont care fade out

Good Day Sunshine

Good day sunshine good day sunshine good day sunshine

I need to laugh and when the sun is out
Ive got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way
Im in love and its a sunny day

Good day sunshine good day sunshine good day sunshine

We take a walk the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

Good day sunshine good day sunshine good day sunshine

Then wed lie beneath the shady tree
I love her and shes loving me
She feels good she knows shes looking fine
Im so proud to know that she is mine

Good day sunshine good day sunshine good day sunshine
Good day sunshine good day sunshine good day sunshine
Good day sunshine good day sunshine good day sunshine
Good day

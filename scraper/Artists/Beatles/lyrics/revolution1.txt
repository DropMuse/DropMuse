Beatles
Revolution 1

Ah take 18

OK

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out in
Dont you know its gonna be alright
Dont you know its gonna be alright
Dont you know its gonna be alright

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
We dont all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright
Dont you know its gonna be alright
Dont you know its gonna be alright

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all love to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know its gonna be alright
Dont you know its gonna be alright
Dont you know its gonna be alright

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Alright alright alright

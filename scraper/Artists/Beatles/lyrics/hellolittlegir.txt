Hello Little Girl

Hello little girl
Hello little girl
Hello little girl

When I see you everyday
I say Mm mm hello little girl
When youre passing on your way
I say Mm mm hello little girl
When I see you passing by
I cry Mm mm hello little girl
When I try to catch your eye
I cry Mm mm hello little girl

I send you flowers but you dont care
You never seem to see me standing there
I often wonder what youre thinking of
I hope its me and love love love

So I hope therell come a day
When youll say Mm youre my little girl

Its not the first time that its happened to me
Its been a long lonely time
And its funny funny to see that Im about to lose my mind mind mind

So I hope therell come a day
When you say Mm mm
Youre my little girl mm mm mm
Youre my little girl mm mm mm
Youre my little girl oh yeah
Youre my little girl

Do do do do do

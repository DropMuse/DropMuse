Beatles
Don't Bother Me

Since shes been gone
I want no one
To talk to me
Its not the same
But Im to blame
Its plain to see

So go away and leave me alone
Dont bother me

I cant believe
That she would leave
Me on my own
Its just not right
Where every night
Im all alone

Ive got no time for you right now
Dont bother me

I know Ill never be the same
If I dont get her back again
Because I know shell always be
The only girl for me

But till shes here
Please dont come near
just stay away
Ill let you know
When shes come home
Untill that the day

Dont come around leave me alone
Dont bother me

Ive got no time for you right now
Dont bother me

I know Ill never be the same
If I dont get her back again
Because I know shell always be
The only girl for me

But till shes here
Please dont come near
Just stay away
Ill let you know
When shes come home
Untill that the day

Dont come around leave me alone
Dont bother me
Dont bother me
Dont bother me

Beatles
Within You Without You

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth then its far too late when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love we could save the world if they only knew

Try to realise its all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see youre really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking about the love thats gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They dont know they cant see are you one of them

When youve seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see were all one
And life flows on within you and without you

All I've Got To Do

Whenever I want you around yeah
All I gotta do
Is call you on the phone
And youll come running home
Yaeh thats all I gotta do

And when I I wanna kiss you yeah
All I gotta do
Is whisper in your ear
The words you long to hear
And Ill be kissing you

And the same goes for me
Whenever you want me at all
Ill be here yes I will
Whenever you call
You just gotta call on me yeah
You just gotta call on me

And when I I wanna kiss you yeah
All I got to do
Is call you on the phone
And youll come running how
Yeah thats all I gotta do

And the same goes for me
Whenever you want me at all
Ill be here yes I will
Whenever you call
You just gotta call on me yeah
You just gotta call on me oh

Hold Me Tight

It feels so right now hold me tight
Tell me Im the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one
So hold me tight tonight tonight
Its you you you you oooo oooo

Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight tonight
Making love to only you
So hold me tight tonight tonight
Its you you you you oooo oooo

Dont know what it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you
It feels so right now feels so right now

Hold me tight
Tell me Im the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one
So hold me tight tonight tonight
Its you you you you oooo oooo

Dont know what it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you
It feels so right now feels so right now

Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight tonight
Making love to only you
So hold me tight tonight tonight
Its you you you you oooo oooo

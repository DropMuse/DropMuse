We Can Work It Out

Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I cant go on
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out
We can work it out

Think of what youre saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that its alright
Think of what Im saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night
We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short and theres no time
For fussing and fighting my friend
I have always thought that its a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
Theres a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short and theres no time

Theres a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out

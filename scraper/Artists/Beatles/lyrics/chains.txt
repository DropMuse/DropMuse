Chains

Chains my babys got me locked up in chains
And they aint the kind that you can see
Whoa oh these chains of love got a hold on me yeah

Chains well I cant break away from these chains
Cant run around cos Im not free
Whoa oh these chains of love wont let me be yeah

I wanna tell you pretty baby
I think youre fine
Id like to love you
But darling Im imprisoned by these

Chains my babys got me locked up in chains
And they aint the kind that you can see
Oh oh these chains of love got a hold on me

Please believe me when I tell you
Your lips are sweet
Id like to kiss them
But I cant break away from all of these

Chains my babys got me locked up in chains
And they aint the kind that you can see
Whoa oh these chains of love got a hold on me yeah

Chains chains of love

Beatles
Glass Onion

I told you about strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well heres another place you can go
Where everything flows
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion

I told you about the walrus and me man
You know that were as close as can be man
Well heres another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul
Standing on the cast iron shore yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet yeah
Looking through a glass onion

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he living there still
Well heres another place you can be
Listen to me
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail joint yeah
Looking through a glass onion

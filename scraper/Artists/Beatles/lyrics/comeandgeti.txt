Beatles
Come And Get It

If you want it here it is
Come and get it
Make your mind up fast

If you want it anytime I can give it
But you better hurry cause it may not last

Did I hear you say that there must be a catch
Will you walk away from a fool and his money

If you want it here it is
Come and get it
But you better hurry cause its going fast

If you want it here it is
Come and get it
Make your mind up fast

If you want it anytime I can give it
But youd better hurry cause it may not last

Did I hear you say that there must be a catch
Will you walk away from a fool and his money

Sonny if you want it here it is
Come and get it
But youd better hurry cause its going fast
Youd better hurry cause its going fast

Woo fool that is money

Sorry if you want it here it is
Come and get it
But youd better hurry cause its going fast
Youd better hurry cause its going fast
Youd better hurry cause its going fast

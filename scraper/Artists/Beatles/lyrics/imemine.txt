I Me Mine

All through the day I me mine
I me mine I me mine
All through the night I me mine
I me mine I me mine
Now theyre frightened of leaving it
Everyones weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day I me mine

IImememine IImememine
IImememine IImememine

All I can hear I me mine
I me mine I me mine
Even those tears I me mine
I me mine I me mine
Noones frightened of playing it
Everyones saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day I me mine

IImeme mine IImeme mine
IImeme mine IImeme mine

All I can hear I me mine
I me mine I me mine
Even those tears I me mine
I me mine I me mine
Noones frightened of playing it
Everyones saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through your life I me mine

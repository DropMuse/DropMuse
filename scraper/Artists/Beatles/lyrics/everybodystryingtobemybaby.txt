Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby

Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

Everybodys trying to be my baby
Everybodys trying to be my baby
Everybodys trying to be my baby now

Well half past nine half past four
Fifty women knocking on my door

Everybodys trying to be my baby
Everybodys trying to be my baby
Everybodys trying to be my baby now

Went out last night I didnt stay late
Fore I got home I had nineteen dates

Everybodys trying to be my baby
Everybodys trying to be my baby
Everybodys trying to be my baby now

Went out last night I didnt stay late
Fore I got home I had nineteen dates

Everybodys trying to be my baby
Everybodys trying to be my baby
Everybodys trying to be my baby now

Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

Everybodys trying to be my baby
Everybodys trying to be my baby
Everybodys trying to be my baby now

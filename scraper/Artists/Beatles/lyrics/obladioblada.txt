Beatles
Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly girl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jewellers stores
Buys a twenty carat golden ring Golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing Sing

Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi oblada life goes on bra

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Ah ha ha ha ha ha

Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand Arm Leg
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

She Came In Through The Bathroom Window

Gonna come out now
ha ha ha
wow look out

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her
Didnt anybody see
Sundays on the phone to Monday
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her
Didnt anybody see
Sundays on the phone to Monday
Tuesdays on the phone to me
Oh yeah

Beatles
Back In The U.S.S.R.

Oh flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didnt get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the USSR
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the USSR Yeah

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee its good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
Im back in the USSR
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the US
Back in the US
Back in the USSR

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgias always on my mind

Aw come on
Ho yeah
Ho yeah
Ho ho yeah
Yeah yeah

Yeah Im back in the USSR
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the USSR

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgias always on my mind

Oh show me around your snowpeaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
Im back in the USSR
Hey you dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the USSR

Oh let me tell you honey
Hey Im back

Yes Im free
Yeah back in the USSR

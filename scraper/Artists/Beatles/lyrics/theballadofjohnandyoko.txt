Beatles
The Ballad Of John And Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said Youve got to go back
You know they didnt even give us a chance

Christ you know it aint easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me

Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
You can make it OK
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain

Christ you know it aint easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The newspapers said Say what you doing in bed
I said Were only trying to get us some peace

Christ you know it aint easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me

Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
Oh boy when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul think

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspapers said Shes gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag

Christ you know it aint easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me

Caught an early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said We wish you success
Its good to have the both of you back

Christ you know it aint easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me

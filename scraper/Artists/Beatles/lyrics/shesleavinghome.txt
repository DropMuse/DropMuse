She's Leaving Home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free

She We gave her most of our lives
Is leaving Sacrificed most of our lives
Home We gave her everything money could buy
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years Bye bye

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband Daddy our babys gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me

She We never thought of ourselves
Is leaving Never a thought for ourselves
Home We struggled hard all our lives to get by
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years Bye bye

Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years Bye bye

Shes leaving home
Bye bye

Glad All Over

Aint no doubt about it
This must be love
One little kiss from you
And I feel glad all over
Oo baby hot dang gilly
Its silly
But Im glad all over

Yeah the goosepimples baby
Cos I feel so good
When you call me like you do
And I feel glad all over
Oo mercy Im rock gone puppy
And Im happy
And Im glad all over

Your touch sewed me
Like an electric wire
Never thought of make love
It dont take much looking
To see what Ive got
But it shows yes it shows
Come on honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Everytime you do
Well I feel glad all over
Oo baby hot dang gilly
Its silly
But Im glad all over
Yeah

Tried to tell you
How Im cooking inside
When were cheek to cheek
My temperature is low
Fever is high
I cant speak
Im too weak

Well come on honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Everytime you do
Well I feel glad all over
Oo baby hot dang gilly
Its silly
But Im glad all over
Hot dang gilly
Its silly
But Im glad all over
Well hot dang gilly
Its silly
But Im glad all over

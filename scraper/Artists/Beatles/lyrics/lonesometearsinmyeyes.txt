Beatles
Lonesome Tears In My Eyes

Oh baby baby baby
Blues and sorrow
And I love you tomorrow
Just suit you just fine
Oh baby baby baby
Blues and sorrow
And I love you tomorrow
Just suit you just fine

I cant forget that you told me
So many promising lies
How must I forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes

Youve broken my heart
Gonna do it again
And I cant forget
The spell that Im in
Cant forget that you told me
So many promising lies
Im atrying to forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes

Youve broken my heart
Gonna do it again
I cant forget
The spell that Im in
I cant forget that you told me
So many promising lies
Im atrying to forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes

Oh baby baby baby
Blues and sorrow
And I love you tomorrow
Itll suit you just fine
Oh baby baby baby
Blues and sorrow
I love you tomorrow
Just suit you just fine

I cant forget that you told me
So many promising lies
Im atrying to forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes

Good Morning, Good Morning

Good morning good morning
Good morning good morning
Good morning ah

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been
Nothing to do its up to you
Ive got nothing to say but its OK

Good morning good morning
Good morning ah

Going to work dont want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town
Everybody knows theres nothing doing
Everything is closed its like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And youre on your own youre in the street

After a while you start to smile now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing is changed its still the same
Ive got nothing to say but its OK

Good morning good morning
Good morning ah

People running round its five oclock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
Its time for tea and meet the wife

Somebody needs to know the time glad that Im here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes
Ive got nothing to say but its OK

Good morning good morning good
Good morning good morning good
Good morning good morning good
Good morning good morning good
Good morning good morning good
Good morning good morning good
Good morning good morning good
Good morning good morning good
Good morning good morning good
Good morning good morning good

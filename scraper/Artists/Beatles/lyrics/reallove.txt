Beatles
Real Love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone
Its real love its real
Yes its real love its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
Its real love its real
Yes its real love its real

Thought Id been in love before
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
Dont need to be alone

Its real love its real
Its real love its real
Yes its real love its real
Its real love its real
Yes its real love its real
Its real love its real
Yes its real love its real
Its real love its real

Dear Prudence

Dear Prudence wont you come out to play
Dear Prudence greet the brand new day
The sun is up the sky is blue
Its beautiful and so are you
Dear Prudence wont you come out to play

Dear Prudence open up your eyes
Dear Prudence see the sunny skies
The wind is low the birds will sing
That you are part of everything
Dear Prudence wont you open up your eyes

Look around round
Look around round round
Look around

Dear Prudence let me see you smile
Dear Prudence like a little child
The clouds will be a daisy chain
So let me see you smile again
Dear Prudence wont you let me see you smile

Dear Prudence wont you come out to play
Dear Prudence greet the brand new day
The sun is up the sky is blue
Its beautiful and so are you
Dear Prudence wont you come out to play

Some Other Guy

Some other guy now has taken my love away from me oh now
Some other guy now has taken away my sweet desire oh now
Some other guy now I just dont wanna hold my hand oh now
Im the lonely one as lonely as I can feel all right

Some other guy now is sippin up the honey like a yellow dog oh now
Some other guy now has taken my love just like Im gone oh now
Some other guy now has taken my love away from me oh now
Im the lonely one as lonely as I can feel all right
Oh oh hoho
Oh yeah Ow Ow

Some other guy is makin me very very mad oh now
Some other guy now is makin my past seem oh so bad oh now
Some other guy now she was the first girl I ever had oh now
Im the lonely one as lonely as I can feel all right
Oh oh hoho
Im atalkin to you right now
Ow

Hey Yeah

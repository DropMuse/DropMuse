In My Life

There are places I remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

In my life I love you more

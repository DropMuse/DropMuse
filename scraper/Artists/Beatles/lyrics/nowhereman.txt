Nowhere Man

Hes a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Doesnt have a point of view
Knows not where hes going to
Isnt he a bit like you and me

Nowhere Man please listen
You dont know what youre missing
Nowhere Man the world is at your command

Hes as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere Man can you see me at all

Nowhere Man dont worry
Take your time dont hurry
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand

Doesnt have a point of view
Knows not where hes going to
Isnt he a bit like you and me

Nowhere Man please listen
You dont know what youre missing
Nowhere Man the world is at your command

Hes a real Nowhere Man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Soldier Of Love

Lay down your arms Soldier of love
And surrender to me Sha la la
Lay down your arms Soldier of love
And love me peacefully Sha la la yeah Sha la la
Use your arms for loving me
Baby thats the way its gotta be Ooh

There aint no reason for you to declare
War on the one that loves you so
So forget the other boys because my love is real
Come off your battlefield

Lay down your arms Soldier of love
And love me peacefully Sha la la
Lay down your arms Soldier of love
And love me tenderly Sha la la yeah Sha la la
Use your arms to hold me tight
Baby I dont wanna fight no more Ooh

The weapons youre using are hurtin me bad
But someday youre gonna see
That my love for you baby is the truest youve ever had
A Soldier of Love thats hard to be

Lay down your arms Soldier of love
And love me peacefully Sha la la
Lay down your arms Soldier of love
And surrender to me Sha la la yeah Sha la la
Use your arms to squeeze and please cos Im the one that loves you so
Yeah soldier of love Baby lay down your arms
Yeah soldier of love Baby lay down your arms
Yeah yeah fade out

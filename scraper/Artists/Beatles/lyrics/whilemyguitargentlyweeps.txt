While My Guitar Gently Weeps

I look at you all see the love there thats sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I dont know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I dont know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice its turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

Well

I dont know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I dont know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

I look at you all see the love there thats sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps

Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah oh ooh

Can't Buy Me Love

Cant buy me love love
Cant buy me love

Ill buy you a diamond ring my friend if it makes you feel alright
Ill get you anything my friend if it makes you feel alright
Cos I dont care too much for money and money cant buy me love

Ill give you all I got to give if you say youll love me too
I may not have a lot to give but what I got Ill give to you
I dont care too much for money money cant buy me love

Cant buy me love everybody tells me so
Cant buy me love no no no no

Say you dont need no diamond ring and Ill be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of thing that money just cant buy
I dont care too much for money money cant buy me love
Owww

Cant buy me love everybody tells me so
Cant buy me love no no no no

Say you dont need no diamond ring and Ill be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of thing that money just cant buy
I dont care too much for money money cant buy me love

Cant buy me love love
Cant buy me love

I'm A Loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

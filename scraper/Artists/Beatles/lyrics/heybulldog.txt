Hey Bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

Childlike
No one understands
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me if youre lonely you can talk to me

Yeah hey oh
Ho ho
Yeah
Ho ho ho ho
Ho ho

Big man Yeah
Walking in the park
Wigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me if youre lonely you can talk to me

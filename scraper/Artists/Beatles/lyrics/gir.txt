Beatles
Girl

Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay
Shes the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
Still you dont regret a single day

Ah girl girl girl

When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I dont know why

Ah girl girl girl

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there You feel a fool
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood Shes cool ooh ooh ooh

Ah girl girl girl

Was told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure
Will she still believe it when hes dead

Ah girl girl girl

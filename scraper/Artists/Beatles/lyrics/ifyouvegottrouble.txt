If You've Got Trouble

If youve got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say youre worried
You cant be as worried as me Oh oh

Youre quite contend to be bad
With all the vantage you had over me
Just cause youre trouble
And dont bring your troubles to me

I dont think its funny
When you ask for money and things
Especially when youre standing there
Wearing diamond and rings Oh oh

You think Im soft in the head
Well try someone softer instead anything
Its not so funny
When you know what money can bring

You better leave me alone
I dont need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two

If youve got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say youre worried
You cant be as worried as me

Youre quite contend to be bad
With all the vantage you had over me
Just cause youre trouble
And dont bring your troubles to me

Ah rock on anybody

You better leave me alone
I dont need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two

If youve got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say youre worried
You cant be as worried as me Oh oh

Youre quite contend to be bad
With all the vantage you had over me
Just cause youre trouble
And dont bring your troubles to me
Just cause youre trouble
And dont bring your troubles to me

Every Little Thing

When Im walking beside her
People tell me Im lucky
Yes I know Im a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Cant stop thinking about her now

Every little thing she does
She does for me yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me oooh

When Im with her Im happy
Just to know that she loves me
Yes I know that she loves me now
There is one thing Im sure of
I will love her forever
For I know love will never die

Every little thing she does
She does for me yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me oooh

Every little thing she does
She does for me yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me oooh
Every little thing
Every little thing

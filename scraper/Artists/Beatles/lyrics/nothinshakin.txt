Nothin' Shakin'

I found it out
What love is all about
And every day
It sure lets out
I see my baby
I get weak in my knees
Theres nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
My pappie told me
Thered be times like these
Theres nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees

We meet the gang
And go to rocking Joes
The cats are something
On the heels and toes
I grab my baby
Tried to give her a squeeze
Theres nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be
Such a doggone tease
Theres nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees

Shes got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
I begged her for kisses
On my bended knees
Oh wont you give me
Some loving baby
Please please please

Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
And the sun will shine
Till that time
She puts my heart at ease
Theres nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
Theres nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees yeah

Shes got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
Im begging for her kisses
On my bended knees
Oh wont you give me
Some of your loving baby
Please please please

Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
And the sun will shine
Till that time
She puts my heart at ease
Theres nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
Theres nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
Theres nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
Theres nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
Theres nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees

Beatles
It's Only Love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh my my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you

Its only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do
Its only love and that is all
But its so hard loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Havent I the right to make it up girl

Its only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do
Its only love and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you loving you

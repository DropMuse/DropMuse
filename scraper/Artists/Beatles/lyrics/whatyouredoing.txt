What You're Doing

Look what youre doing Im feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask you
What youre doing to me

You got me running and theres no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What youre doing to me

Ive been waiting here for you
Wondring what youre gonna do
Should you need a love thats true
Its me

Please stop your lying youve got me crying girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What youre doing to me

Ive been waiting here for you
Wondring what youre gonna do
Should you need a love thats true
Its me

Please stop your lying youve got me crying girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What youre doing to me
What youre doing to me
What youre doing to me

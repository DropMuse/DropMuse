Oh! Darling

Oh Darling please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh Darling if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you ooh
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me
You didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me
You didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh Darling if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me darling

When you told me ooh
You didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me
You didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh Darling please believe me
Ill never let you down
Oh believe me darling
Believe me when I tell you ooh
Ill never do you no harm

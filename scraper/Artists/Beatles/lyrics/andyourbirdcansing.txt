Beatles
And Your Bird Can Sing

You tell me that youve got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you dont get me you dont get me

You say youve seen Seven Wonders and your bird is green
But you cant see me you cant see me

When your prized possessions start to weigh you down
Look in my direction Ill be round Ill be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken Ill be round Ill be round

You tell me that youve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you cant hear me you cant hear me

Not Guilty

Not guilty
For getting in your way while you try to steal the day
Not guilty
Im not nodding for the rest Im not trying to steal you vest
I end up trying to be smart I only want what I can get
Im really sorry for your aging head but like you heard me said
Not guilty

Though you signing me a writ while Im trying to do my bit
I dont expect to take your hoard I only want what I can get
Im really sorry that youre underfed but like you heard me said
Not guilty

Not guilty
For looking like a freak making friends with every Sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray on the road to Masalay
I wont upset the apple cart I only want what I can get
Im really sorry that youve been mislead but like you heard me said
Not guilty

You Really Got A Hold On Me

I dont like you
But I love you
Seems that Im always
Thinking of you
Oh oh oh
You treat me badly
I love you madly
Youve really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me

Baby

I dont want you
But I need you
Dont want to kiss you
But I need to
Oh oh oh
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now
Youve really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me

Baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me hold me hold me hold me
Tighter
Tighter

I want to leave you
Dont want to stay here
Dont want to spend
Another day here
Oh oh oh I want to split now
I just cant quit now
Youve really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me

Baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me hold me hold me hold me

You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me

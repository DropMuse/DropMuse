I got arms that long to hold you
And keep you by my side
I got lips that long to kiss you
And keep you satisfied oooh

And keep you by my side
I got lips that long to kiss you
And keep you satisfied oooh

If theres anything that you want
If theres anything I can do
Just call on me and Ill send it along
With love from me to you
To you to you to you

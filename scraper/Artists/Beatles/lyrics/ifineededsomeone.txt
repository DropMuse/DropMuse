If I Needed Someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone

Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah ah ah ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone

Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah ah

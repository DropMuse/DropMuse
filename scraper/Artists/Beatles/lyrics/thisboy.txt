This Boy

That boy took my love away
Though hell regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again

That boy isnt good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

Oh and this boy would be happy
Just to love you but oh my
That boy wont be happy
Till hes seen you cry

This boy wouldnt mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again

This boy
This boy
This boy fade out

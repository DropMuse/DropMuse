Little Child

Little child little child
Little child wont you dance with me
Im so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

Little child little child
Little child wont you dance with me
Im so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

If you want someone
To make you feel so fine
Then well have some fun
When youre mine all mine
So come come on come on

Little child little child
Little child wont you dance with me
Im so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

When youre by my side
Youre the only one
Dont you run and hide
Just come on come on
So come on come on come on

Little child little child
Little child wont you dance with me
Im so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me
Baby take a chance with me
Baby take a chance with me

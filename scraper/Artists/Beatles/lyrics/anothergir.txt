Another Girl

For I have got another girl another girl
Youre making me say that Ive got nobody but you
But as from today well Ive got somebody thats new
I aint no fool and I dont take what I dont want

For I have got another girl another girl
Shes sweeter than all the girls and I met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so Im telling you This time youd better stop

For I have got another girl another girl
Who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend

I dont want to say that Ive been unhappy with you
But as from today well Ive seen somebody thats new
I aint no fool and I dont take what I dont want

For I have got another girl another girl
Who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend

I dont want to say that Ive been unhappy with you
But as from today well Ive seen somebody thats new
I aint no fool and I dont take what I dont want

For I have got another girl another girl
Another girl

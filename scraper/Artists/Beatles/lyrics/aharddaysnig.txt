A Hard Day's Night

Its been a hard days night and Id been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan cos when I get you alone
You know I feel OK

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight tight yeah

Its been a hard days night and Id been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright owww

So why on earth should I moan cos when I get you alone
You know I feel OK

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight tight yeah

Its been a hard days night and Id been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright

I'm Happy Just To Dance With You

Before this dance is through
I think Ill love you too
Im so happy when you dance with me

I dont want to kiss or hold your hand
If its funny try and understand
There is really nothing else Id rather do
Cos Im happy just to dance with you

I dont need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world theres nothing I would rather do
Cos Im happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you
Its everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think Ill love you too
Im so happy when you dance with me

If somebody tries to take my place
Lets pretend we just cant see his face
In this world theres nothing I would rather do
Cos Im happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you
Its everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think Ill love you too
Im so happy when you dance with me

If somebody tries to take my place
Lets pretend we just cant see his face
In this world theres nothing I would rather do
Ive discovered Im in love with you
Cos Im happy just to dance with you

Beatles
Roll Over Beethoven

Well gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
Its a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

You know my temperatures rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart beating rhythm
While my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I caught it off the writer
Sittin down by the rhythm reviews
Roll over Beethoven
Were rockin in two by two

Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just triffle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
A rocking in two by two  Ooo

Well early in the morning
Im a giving you the warning
Dont you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
Ill play my fiddle
Aint got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
Shes got a crazy partner
Oughta see them reel an rock
Long as shes got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

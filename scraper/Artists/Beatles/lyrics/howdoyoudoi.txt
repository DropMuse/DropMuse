How Do You Do It

How do you do what you do to me
I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
Id do it to you

How do you do what you do to me
Im feeling blue
Wish I knew how you do it to me
But I havent a clue

You give me a feeling in my heart oohlala
Like an arrow piercing through it
I suppose that you think youre very smart
But wont you tell me how do you do it

How do you do what you do to me
I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
Id do it to you

You give me a feeling in my heart oohlala
Like an arrow piercing through it
I suppose that you think youre very smart
But wont you tell me how do you do it

How do you do what you do to me
I wish I knew
Wish I knew how you do it to me
But I havent a clue

Wish I knew how you do it to me
Id do it to you
Wish I knew how you do it to me
Id do it to you

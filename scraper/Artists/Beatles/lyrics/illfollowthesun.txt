Beatles
I'll Follow The Sun

One day youll look to see Ive gone
For tomorrow may rain so Ill follow the sun
Some day youll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain so Ill follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know oooh

One day youll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain so Ill follow the sun

Yea tomorrow may rain so Ill follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end youll know oooh

One day youll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain so Ill follow the sun

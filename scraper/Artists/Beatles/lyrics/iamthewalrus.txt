Beatles
I Am The Walrus

I am he
As you are he
As you are me
And we are all together

See how they run
Like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
Im crying

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee shirt
Stupid bloody Tuesday
Man you been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long

I am the eggman Ooh
They are the eggmen Ooh
I am the walrus
Goo goo g joob

Mister city pliceman sitting pretty
Little plicemen in a row
See how they fly
Like Lucy in the sky
See how they run
Im crying
Im crying Im crying Im crying

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dogs eye
Crabalocker fishwife pornographic priestess
Boy you been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down

I am the eggman Ooh
They are the eggmen Ooh
I am the walrus
Goo goo g joob

Sitting in an English
Garden waiting for the sun
If the sun dont come
You get a tan from standing in the English rain

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g joob g goo goo g joob

Expert texpert choking smokers
Dont you think the joker laughs at you
See how they smile
Like pigs in a sty see how they snied
Im crying

Semolina pilchards
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementry penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

I am the eggman Ooh
They are the eggmen Ooh
I am the walrus
Goo goo g joob
Goo goo g joob
G goo goo g joob
Goo goo g joob goo goo g goo g goo goo g joob joob
Joob joob

She Said, She Said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born

I said Who put all those things in your head
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born

She said You dont understand what I said
I said No no no youre wrong
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born

She said You dont understand what I said
I said No no no youre wrong
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
I know what its like to be dead

Beatles
Rock And Roll Music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man they were blowing like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinking home brew from a water cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

And started playing that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
Its got a back beat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
Its got a back beat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

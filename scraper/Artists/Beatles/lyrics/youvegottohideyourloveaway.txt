Beatles
You've Got To Hide Your Love Away

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If shes gone I cant go on
Feeling twofoot small

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey youve got to hide your love away
Hey youve got to hide your love away

How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them seeing them
In the state Im in

How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey youve got to hide your love away
Hey youve got to hide your love away

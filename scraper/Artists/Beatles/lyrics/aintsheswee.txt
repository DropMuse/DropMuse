Ain't She Sweet

Oh aint she sweet
Well see her walking down that street
Yes I ask you very confidentially
Aint she sweet

Oh aint she nice
Well look her over once or twice
Yes I ask you very confidentially
Aint she nice

Just cast an eye
In her direction
Oh me oh my
Aint that perfection

Oh I repeat
Well dont you think thats kind of neat
Yes I ask you very confidentially
Aint she sweet

Oh aint she sweet
Well see her walking down that street
Well I ask you very confidentially
Aint she sweet

Oh aint that nice
Well look it over once or twice
Yes I ask you very confidentially
Aint she nice

Just cast an eye
In her direction
Oh me oh my
Aint that perfection

Oh I repeat
Well dont you think thats kind of neat
Yes I ask you very confidentially
Aint she sweet

Oh aint she sweet
Well see her walking down that street
Well I ask you very confidentially
Aint she sweet
Well I ask you very confidentially
Aint she sweet

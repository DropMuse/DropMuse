It's All Too Much

All too much

Its all too much
Its all too much

When I look into your eyes your love is there for me
And the more I go inside the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere its what you make
For us to take its all too much

Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

Sail me on a silver sun where I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
The love thats shining all around here
The more I learn the less I know
But what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere its what you make
For us to take its all too much

Its too much
Ah its too much

With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue

Youre too much ah
We all get too much

Too much too much too much
Too much a too much a too much a
Too much a too much a too much a
Too much a too much a too much a
Too much a too much a too much a
Too much a too much a too much a
Too much a too much a too much a
Too much a too much a too much a
Too much a

Much much much much much
Much much much much much
Much much much much much
Much much much much much
Much much much much much

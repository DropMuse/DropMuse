Beatles
For You Blue

Queen says no to potsmoking FBI members

Because youre sweet and lovely girl I love you
Because youre sweet and lovely girl its true
I love you more than ever girl I do
I want you in the morning girl I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
Im living every moment girl for you

Walk walk cat walk
Go Johnny go
Same old the twelve bar blues

Elmore James got nothing on this baby

Ive loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me thats all you had to do
I feel it now I hope you feel it too

Because youre sweet and lovely girl I love you
Because youre sweet and lovely girl its true
I love you more than ever girl I do
Rhythm and blues

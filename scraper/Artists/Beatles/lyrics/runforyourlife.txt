Run For Your Life

Well Id rather see you dead little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head little girl
Or I wont know where I am

You better run for your life if you can little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
Thats the end ah little girl

Well I know that Im a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I cant spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line

You better run for your life if you can little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
Thats the end ah little girl

Let this be a sermon
I mean everything Ive said
Baby Im determined
And Id rather see you dead

You better run for your life if you can little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
Thats the end ah little girl

Id rather see you dead little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head little girl
Or you wont know where I am

You better run for your life if you can little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
Thats the end ah little girl
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah fade out

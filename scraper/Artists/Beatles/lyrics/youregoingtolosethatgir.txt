You're Going To Lose That Girl

Youre going to lose that girl
Youre going to lose that girl
If you dont take her out tonight
Shes going to change her mind
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind

Youre going to lose that girl

If you dont treat her right my friend
Youre going to find her gone
Cos I will treat her right and then
Youll be the lonely one

Youre going to lose that girl

Ill make a point
Of taking her away from you yeah
The way you treat her what else can I do

Youre going to lose that girl
Youre going to lose that girl

The way you treat her what else can I do

If you dont take her out tonight
Shes going to change her mind
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind
Youre going to lose that girl
Youre going to lose that girl
Youre going to lose that girl

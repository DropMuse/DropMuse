All You Need Is Love

Love love love

Theres nothing you can do that cant be done
Nothing you can sing that cant be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
Its easy

Nothing you can make that cant be made
No one you can save that cant be saved
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
Its easy

Fixing A Hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong
See the people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door

Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh ooh ooh ah ah
Hey hey hey hey

And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong
Silly people run around
They worry me and never ask me
Why they dont get past my door

Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh ooh ooh ah ah

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
Stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go oh
Where it will go oh

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go fade out

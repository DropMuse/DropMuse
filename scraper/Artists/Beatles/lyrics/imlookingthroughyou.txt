I'm Looking Through You

Im looking through you where did you go
I thought I knew you what did I know
You dont look different but you have changed
Im looking through you youre not the same

Your lips are moving I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing but the words arent clear
You dont sound different Ive learned the game
Im looking through you youre not the same

Why tell me why did you not treat me right
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me the same old way
You were above me but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you and youre nowhere

Why tell me why did you not treat me right
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you where did you go
I thought I knew you what did I know
You dont look different but you have changed
Im looking through you youre not the same

Yeah
Oh baby Im changed
Ah Im looking through you
Yeah Im looking through you

All My Loving

Close your eyes and Ill kiss you
Tomorrow Ill miss you
Remember Ill always be true
And then while Im away
Ill write home every day
And Ill send all my loving to you

Ill pretend that Im kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while Im away
Ill write home every day
And Ill send all my loving to you

All my loving I will send to you
All my loving darling Ill be true

Close your eyes and Ill kiss you
Tomorrow Ill miss you
Remember Ill always be true
And then while Im away
Ill write home every day
And Ill send all my loving to you

All my loving I will send to you
All my loving darling Ill be true
All my loving all my loving ooh
All my loving I will send to you

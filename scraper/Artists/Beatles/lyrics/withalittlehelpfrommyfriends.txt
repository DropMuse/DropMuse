Beatles
With A Little Help From My Friends

Billy Shears

What would you think if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song
And Ill try not to sing out of key
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends

What do I do when my love is away
Does it worry you to be alone
How do I feel by the end of the day
Are you sad because youre on your own
No I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love

Would you believe in a love at first sight
Yes Im certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light
I cant tell you but I know its mine
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends
Oh Im gonna try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love

Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends

I Forgot To Remember To Forget

I forgot to remember to forget her
I cant seem to get her off my mind
I thought Id never miss her
But Ive found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time

Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That Id soon forget wed ever met
But something sure is wrong
Cos Im so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget

Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That Id soon forget wed ever met
But something sure is wrong
Cos Im so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget

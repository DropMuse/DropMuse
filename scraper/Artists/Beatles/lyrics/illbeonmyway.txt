I'll Be On My Way

The sun is fading away
Thats the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
Ill be on my way

Just one kiss and Ill go
Dont hide the tears that dont show
As the June light turns to moonlight
Ill be on my way

To where the winds dont blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go

They were right I was wrong
True love didnt last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
Ill be on my way hey

To where the winds dont blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go

They were right I was wrong
True love didnt last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
Ill be on my way hey
Ill be on my way oh
Ill be on my way oh
Ill be on my way fade out

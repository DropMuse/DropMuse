That'll Be The Day

Thatll be the day when you say goodbye yes
thatll be the day when you make me cry
Oh you say youre gonna leave
when I die
Well you give me all your lovin and your turtle
dovin
All your hugs and kisses and your money too you
say you love me baby until you tell me
maybeThat some day well Ill be through
cause
Thatll be the day when you make me cry yes
thatll be the day when you say goodbye
Oh you say youre gonna leave
you know its a lie  cause thatll be the day
when I die
When Cupid shot his dart he shot it at your heart
So if we ever part and I leave you
You say you told me and you told me boldly
That someday well Ill be through cause
Thatll be the day when you say goodbye yes
thatll be the day when you make me cry
Oh you say youre gonna leave
you know its a lie  cause thatll be the day
when I die
Thatll be the day oooh
Thatll be the day oooh
Thatll be the day oooh
Thatll be the day

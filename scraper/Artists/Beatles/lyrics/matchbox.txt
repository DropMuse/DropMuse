Matchbox

I said Im sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said Im sitting here wondering
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I aint got no matches but I sure
Got a long way to go

Im an ole poor boy and Im a
Long way from home
Im an ole poor boy and Im a
Long way from home
Ill never be happy cause everything Ive
Ever did was wrong

Well if you dont want my peaches honey
Please dont shake my tree
Well if you dont want my peaches honey
Please dont mess around my tree
I got news for you baby
Leave me here in misery

Well let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Well let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here
Watch how your puppy dog runs

I said Im sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said Im sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I aint got no matches but I sure
Got a long way to go

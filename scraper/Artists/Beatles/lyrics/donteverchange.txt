Don't Ever Change

You never wear a stitch of lace
Your powders never on your face
Youre always wearing jeans except on Sunday
So please dont ever change
Now dont you ever change
I kinda like you just the way you are

You dont know the latest dance
But when its time to make romance
Your kisses let me know youre not a tomboy
So please dont ever change
Now dont you ever change
Just promise me youre always gonna to be
As sweet as you are

I love you when youre happy
I love you when youre blue
I love you when youre mad at me
So how can I get tired of you
A lots of other girls Ive seen
They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
So please dont ever change
Now dont you ever change
Just promise me youre always gonna to be
As sweet as you are

Please dont ever change
Dont you ever change
Please dont ever change
Dont you ever change fade out

Well you know I love baby

Babe I woke up this morning
Lucille was not inside

But all their lips were tight

Lucille

Well Im talking to you baby
Ill never put you on
Aaaah Wah

Well Lucille
Baby do your sisters will
Oo Lucille
Yeah baby do your sisters will
Well you went up and married
But I love you still

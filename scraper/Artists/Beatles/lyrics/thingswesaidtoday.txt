Things We Said Today

You say you will love me
If I have to go
Youll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when Im lonely
Wishing you werent so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

You say youll be mine girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when were dreaming
Deep in love not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me Im just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and thats enough

To make you mine girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time girl
Well go on and on
Someday when were dreaming
Deep in love not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me Im just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
Though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and thats enough

To make you mine girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time girl
Well go on and on
Someday when were dreaming
Deep in love not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Baby's In Black

Oh dear what can I do
Babys in black and Im feeling blue
Tell me oh what can I do

She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though hell never come back shes dressed in black
Oh dear what can I do
Babys in black and Im feeling blue
Tell me oh what can I do

I think of her but she thinks only of him
And though its only a whim she thinks of him
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made
Dear what can I do
Babys in black and Im feeling blue
Tell me oh what can I do

Oh how long it will take
Till she sees the mistake she has made
Dear what can I do
Babys in black and Im feeling blue
Tell me oh what can I do

She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though hell never come back shes dressed in black
Oh dear what can I do
Babys in black and Im feeling blue
Tell me oh what can I do

Octopus's Garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an octopuss garden in the shade
Hed let us in knows where weve been
In his octopuss garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An octopuss garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an octopuss garden in the shade

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopuss garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an octopuss garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
Lies beneath the ocean waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
Happy and theyre safe

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an octopuss garden with you
In an octopuss garden with you
In an octopuss garden with you

This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasnt you
But I saw you peep through your window

I saw the lie I saw the lie
I know that you saw me
As I looked up to see your face

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
Thats a lie
Cause I know where youve been
I saw you walk in your door

I nearly died I nearly died
Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

Ive tried to telephone
They said you were not home
Thats a lie
Cause I know where youve been
I saw you walk in your door

I nearly died I nearly died
Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

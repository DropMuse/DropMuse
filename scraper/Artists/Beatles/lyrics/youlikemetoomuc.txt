You Like Me Too Much

Though youve gone away this morning
Youll be back again tonight
Telling me therell be no next time
If I dont just dont treat you right
Youll never leave me and you know its true
Cos you like me too much and I like you

Youve tried before to leave me
But you havent got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
Youll never leave me and you know its true
Cos you like me too much and I like you

I really do and its nice when you believe me
If you leave me

I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
Cos I couldt really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldnt let you leave me cos its true
Cos you like me too much and I like you

Cos you like me too much and I like you
I really do and its nice when you believe me
If you leave me

I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
Cos I couldt really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldnt let you leave me cos its true
Cos you like me too much and I like you
Cos you like me too much and I like you

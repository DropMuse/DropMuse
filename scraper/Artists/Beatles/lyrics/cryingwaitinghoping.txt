Crying, Waiting, Hoping

Crying waiting hoping youll come back
I just cant seem to get you off my mind
Crying waiting hoping youll come back
Youre the one I love I think about you all the time

Crying do do do do tear keep a falling all night long
Waiting do do do do it seems so useless I know its wrong
Keep a crying waiting hoping youll come back
Maybe someday soon itll change and youll be mine

Crying do do do do tears keep a falling all night long
Waiting do do do do it seems so useless I know its wrong
Keep a crying waiting hoping youll come back
Maybe someday soon itll change and youll be mine
Crying waiting hoping

I Got To Find My Baby

Im gonna search this town
From door to door
The love I crave
I cant find no more

I got to find my baby
I declare there aint no lie
I aint had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
Cos I know my whole lifes
Gonna be one solid mess

I got to find my baby
I declare there aint no lie
I aint had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

Well ever since the day
That she said we were through
Ive been nervous
And shook up too

I got to find my baby
I declare there aint no lie
I aint had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

Well I dont care if the last thing
I ever done in my life
Is to find that little woman
Make her my wife

I got to find my baby
I declare there aint no lie
I aint had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

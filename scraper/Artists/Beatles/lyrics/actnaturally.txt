Beatles
Act Naturally

Theyre gonna put me in the movies
Theyre gonna make a big star out of me
Well make a film about a man thats sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Well Ill bet you Im gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
Cos I can play the part so well

Well I hope youll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Well make the scene about a man thats sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
Ill play the part and I wont need rehearsing
All I gotta do is act naturally

Well Ill bet you Im gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
Cos I can play the part so well

Well I hope youll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

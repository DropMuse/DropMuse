Any Time At All

Any time at all any time at all
Any time at all all youve gotta do is call and Ill be there

If you need somebody to love
Just look into my eyes
Ill be there to make you feel right

If youre feeling sorry and sad
Id really sympathize
Dont you be sad just call me tonight

Any time at all any time at all
Any time at all all youve gotta do is call and Ill be there

If the sun has faded away
Ill try to make it shine
Theres nothing I wont do
When you need a shoulder to cry on
I hope it will be mine
Call me tonight and Ill come to you

Any time at all any time at all
Any time at all all youve gotta do is call and Ill be there

Any time at all any time at all
Any time at all all youve gotta do is call and Ill be there
Any time at all all youve gotta do is call and Ill be there

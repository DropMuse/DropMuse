Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

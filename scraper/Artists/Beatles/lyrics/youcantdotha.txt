You Can't Do That

I got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
Im gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before oh
You cant do that

Well its the second time Ive caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time I think its a sin
I think Ill let you down Let you down
Leave you flat Gonna let you down and leave you flat
Because Ive told you before oh
You cant do that

Everybodys green
Cos Im the one who won your love
But if theyd seen
Youre talking that way theyd laugh in my face

So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine
I cant help my feelings Ill go out of my mind
Im gonna let you down Let you down
And leave you flat Gonna let you down and leave you flat
Because Ive told you before oh
You cant do that oh

You cant do that
You cant do that
You cant do that
You cant do that
You cant do that

Everybodys green
Cos Im the one who won your love
But if theyd seen
Youre talking that way theyd laugh in my face

So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine
I cant help my feelings Ill go out of my mind
Im gonna let you down Let you down
And leave you flat Gonna let you down and leave you flat
Because Ive told you before oh
You cant do that

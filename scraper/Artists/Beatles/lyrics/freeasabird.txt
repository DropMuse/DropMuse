Free As A Bird

Free as a bird
Its the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Home home and dry
Like a homing bird Ill fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other

Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much
It always made me feel so

Free as a bird
Like the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Home home and dry
Like a homing bird Ill fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew
Always made me feel so free

Ah
Ah
Ah

Free as a bird
Its the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Oooooo

Free

Turn out nice again mother

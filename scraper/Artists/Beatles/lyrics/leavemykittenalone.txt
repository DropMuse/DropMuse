Leave My Kitten Alone

You better leave my kitten all alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
But I told you big fat bulldog
You better leave her alone

You better leave my kitten all alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
This dog is gonna get you
If you dont leave her alone

Well MrDog Im gonna hit you
On the top of your head
That child is gonna miss you
You gonna wish that you were dead
If you dont leave my kitten all alone
Well I told you big fat bulldog
You better leave her alone

Alright

Well Mr Dog Im gonna hit you
On the top of your head
That girl is gonna miss you
You gonna wish that you were dead
If you dont leave my kitten all alone oh yeah
Well I told you big fat bulldog
You better leave her alone

You better leave yeah you better leave
You better leave oh you got to leave
Hey hey well I told you big fat bulldog fade out

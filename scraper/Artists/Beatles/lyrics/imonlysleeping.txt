I'm Only Sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed float up stream Float up stream

Please dont wake me no dont shake me
Leave me where I am Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need Theres no need

Please dont spoil my day Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling

Please dont spoil my day Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Ooh yeah

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed float up stream Float up stream

Please dont wake me no dont shake me
Leave me where I am Im only sleeping

Good Night

Now its time to say good night
Good night sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me Dream sweet
Dream sweet dreams for you

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me Dream sweet
Dream sweet dreams for you

Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmmm

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me Dream sweet
Dream sweet dreams for you

Good night good night everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night

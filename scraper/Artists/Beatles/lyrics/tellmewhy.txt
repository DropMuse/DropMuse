Tell Me Why

Tell me why you cried and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried and why you lied to me

Well I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan

Tell me why you cried and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried and why you lied to me

If theres something I have said or done
Tell me what and Ill apologise
If you dont really cant go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes

Tell me why you cried and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried and why you lied to me

Well I beg you on my bended knees
If youll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
Cos I really cant stand it Im so in love with you

Tell me why you cried and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried and why you lied to me

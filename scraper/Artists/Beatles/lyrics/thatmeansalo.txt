That Means A Lot

A friend says that your love
Wont mean a lot
And you know that your love
Is all youve got
At times things are so fine
And at times theyre not
But when she says she loves you
That means a lot

A friend says that a love
Is never true
And you know that this
Dont apply on you
A touch can mean so much
When its all youve got
When she says she loves you
That means a lot

Love can be deep inside
Love can be suicide
Cant you see you cant hide
What you feel when its real

A friend says that your love
Wont mean a lot
And you know that your love
Is all youve got
A touch can mean so much
When its all youve got
But when she says she loves you
That means a lot

Cant you see yeah
Cant you see yeah
Cant you see yeah
Cant you see yeah
Cant you see yeah
Cant you see yeah
Cant you see yeah
Cant you see yeah fade out

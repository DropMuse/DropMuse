Beatles
Drive My Car

Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby Cant you see
I wanna be famous a star on the screen
But you can do something in between

Baby you can drive my car
Yes Im gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I love you

I told a girl that my prospects were good
And she said baby Its understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time

Baby you can drive my car
Yes Im gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I love you
Beep beepm beep beep yeah

Baby you can drive my car
Yes Im gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I love you

I told that girl I can start right away
And she said Listen baby I got something to say
I got no car and its breaking my heart
But Ive found a driver and thats a start

Baby you can drive my car
Yes Im gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I love you
Beep beepm beep beep yeah
Beep beepm beep beep yeah
Beep beepm beep beep yeah
Beep beepm beep beep yeah fade out

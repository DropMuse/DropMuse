Then theres this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
Theyd get a little bit older and a litter slower but
Its all the same thing in this case manufactured by someone whos always
Umpteen your fathers giving it diddlyidee
District was leaving intended to pay for

Number 9 number 9

Whos to know
Who was to know

Number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9

I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever youre doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives

Number 9 number 9 number 9

People ride people ride
Ride ride ride ride ride
Ride Ride

9 number 9 number 9 number 9

Ive missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with like wow
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rouge doctors have brought this specimen

I have nobodys shortcuts aha

9 number 9

With the situation

They are standing still

The plan the telegram

Ooh ooh

Number 9 number

Ooh

A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low

Alright

Number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9

So the wife called me and wed better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So any road we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasnt any good at all
So I said Id marry join the fucking navy and went to sea

In my broken chair my wings are broken and so is my hair
Im not in the mood for whirling

Um da
Aaah

How
Dogs for dogging hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming

Only to find the nightwatchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

Number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9 number 9

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The twist

Eldorado

Take this brother may it serve you well

Maybe its nothing
Aaah
Maybe its nothing
What What Oh

Maybe even then
Impervious in London
Could be difficult thing
Its quick like rush for peace is
Because its so much
It was like being naked

If you became naked

Beatles
I Just Don't Understand

Well you call me your baby
When you hold in my hand
But the way that you hurt me
I just dont understand

Well you say that you need me
Like an ocean needs sand
But the way you deceive me
I just dont understand

Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a onesided love
I just dont understand

Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a onesided love
I just dont understand

Well you call me your baby
When you hold in my hand
Oh how you can hurt me
I just dont understand

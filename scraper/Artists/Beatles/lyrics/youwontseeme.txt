You Won't See Me

When I call you up
Your lines engaged
I have had enough
So act your age
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you wont see me You wont see me
You wont see me You wont see me

I dont know why you
Should want to hide
But I cant get through
My hands are tied
I wont want to stay
I dont have much to say
But I cant turn away
And you wont see me You wont see me
You wont see me You wont see me

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldnt mind
If I knew what I was missing

Though the days are few
Theyre filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes it seems so long
Girl since youve been gone
And I just cant go on
If you wont see me You wont see me
You wont see me You wont see me

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldnt mind
If I knew what I was missing

Though the days are few
Theyre filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes it seems so long
Girl since youve been gone
And I just cant go on
If you wont see me You wont see me
You wont see me You wont see me

I Want To Tell You

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words they seem to slip away

When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
Its alright
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me its not my mind
That is confusing things

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why
I dont mind
I could wait forever Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why
I dont mind
I could wait forever Ive got time Ive got time Ive got time

Hallelujah, I Love Her So

Let me tell you about a girl I know
Shes my baby and I love her so
Every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
Thats why I know yes I know
Hallelujah I just love her so

When I call her on the telephone
She says Baby Im all alone
By the time I count from one to four
Shell be knocking on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
And there aint nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
She says Baby everything is alright
Thats why I know thats why I know
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love that chick so

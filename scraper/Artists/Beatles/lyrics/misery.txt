Misery

The world is treating me bad Misery

Im the kind of guy
Who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad Misery

Ive lost her now for sure
I wont see her no more
Its gonna be a drag Misery

Ill remember all the little things weve done
Cant she see shell always be the only one only one

Send her back to me
Cos everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery

Ill remember all the little things weve done
Shell remember and shell miss her only one lonely one

Send her back to me
Cos everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery Oh oh oh
In misery Ooh ee ooh ooh
My misery La la la la la la

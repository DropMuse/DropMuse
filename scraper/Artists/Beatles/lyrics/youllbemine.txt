You'll Be Mine

Well darling all the night
Youll be mine and I know
Youll be mine
Till you die
Youll be mine

And so all the night
Youll be mine
Youll be mine
And the stars
Always shine
Youll be mine
Oh

My darling
When you burnt that toast the other morning
I I looked into you eyes and I could see that National Health eyeball
and I loved you like I never done I have never done before

Oh darling
In your eyes
And youll be mine
You will be mine
Youll be mine
At the star and so
Youll be mine

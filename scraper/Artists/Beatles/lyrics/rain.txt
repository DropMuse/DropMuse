Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes if the rain comes

When the sun shines they slip into the shade
when the sun shines down
And sip their lemonade
when the sun shines down
When the sun shines when the sun shines

Rain I dont mind
Shine the weathers fine

I can show you that when it starts to rain
when the rain comes down
Everythings the same
when the rain comes down
I can show you I can show you

Rain I dont mind
Shine the weathers fine

Can you hear me that when it rains and shines
when it rains and shines
Its just a state of mind
when it rains and shines
Can you hear me can you hear me

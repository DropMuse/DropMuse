Carry That Weight

Boy youre going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy youre going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

Boy youre going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy youre going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

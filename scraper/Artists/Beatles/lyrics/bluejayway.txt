Beatles
Blue Jay Way

Theres a fog upon LA
And my friends have lost their way
Well be over soon they said
Now theyve lost themselves instead

Please dont be long
Please dont you be very long
Please dont be long for I may be asleep

Well it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
Theres so many there to meet

Please dont be long
Please dont you be very long
Please dont be long for I may be asleep

Now its past my bed I know
And Id really like to go
Soon will be the break of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way

Please dont be long
Please dont you be very long
Please dont be long for I may be asleep

Please dont be long
Please dont you be very long
Please dont be long

Please dont be long
Please dont you be very long
Please dont be long

Please dont be long
Please dont you be very long
Please dont be long

Dont be long dont be long dont be long
Dont be long dont be long dont be long

Sure To Fall (In Love With You)

Im sure to fall fall in love
Im sure to fall in love with you
You are so sweet and so near
Im sure to fall in love with you

So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling dont ever let me go

Loving you is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life

So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling dont ever let me go

Loving you is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life

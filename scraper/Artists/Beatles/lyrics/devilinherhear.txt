Devil In Her Heart

Shes got the devil in her heart
But her eyes they tantalize
Shes gonna tear your heart apart
Oh her lips they really thrill me

Ill take my chances
For romance is
So important to me
Shell never hurt me
She wont desert me
Shes an angel sent to me

Shes got the devil in her heart
No no this I cant believe
Shes gonna tear your heart apart
No no nay will she deceive

I cant believe that shell ever ever go
Not when she hugs and says she loves me so
Shell never hurt me
She wont desert me
Listen cant you see

Shes got the devil in her heart
Oh no no no this I cant believe
Shes gonna tear your heart apart
No no nay will she deceive

Dont take chances if your romance is
So important to you
Shell never hurt me
She wont desert me
Shes an angel sent to me

Shes got the devil in her heart
Oh no no no no this I cant believe
Shes gonna tear your heart apart
No no nay will she deceive

Shes got the devil in her heart
No shes an angel sent to me
Shes got the devil in her heart
No shes an angel sent to me

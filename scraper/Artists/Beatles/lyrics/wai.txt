Wait

Its been a long time
Now Im coming back home
Ive been away now
Oh how Ive been alone

Wait till I come back to your side
Well forget the tears weve cried

But if your heart breaks
Dont wait turn me away
And if your hearts strong
Hold on I wont delay

Wait till I come back to your side
Well forget the tears weve cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That Ive been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
Ill trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

Its been a long time
Now Im coming back home
Ive been away now
Oh how Ive been alone

Wait till I come back to your side
Well forget the tears weve cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That Ive been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
Ill trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

But if your heart breaks
Dont wait turn me away
And if your hearts strong
Hold on I wont delay

Wait till I come back to your side
Well forget the tears weve cried

Its been a long time
Now Im coming back home
Ive been away now
Oh how Ive been alone

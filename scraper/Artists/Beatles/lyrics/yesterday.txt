Yesterday

Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though theyre here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday

Suddenly Im not half the man I used to be
Theres a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I dont know she wouldnt say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I dont know she wouldnt say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm

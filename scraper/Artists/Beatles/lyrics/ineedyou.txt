I Need You

You dont realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
Im lonely as can be
I need you

Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me
I didnt realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me oh yes you told me you dont want my lovin anymore
Thats when it hurt me and feeling like this I just cant go on anymore

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So come on back and see just what you mean to me I need you

But when you told me you dont want my lovin anymore
Thats when it hurt me and feeling like this I just cant go on anymore

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So come on back and see just what you mean to me
I need you
I need you
I need you

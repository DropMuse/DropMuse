I Saw Her Standing There

1234

Well she was just 17
You know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another Ooh
When I saw her standing there

Well she looked at me and I I could see
That before too long Id fall in love with her
She wouldnt dance with another Whooh
When I saw her standing there

Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoah we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now Ill never dance with another Whooh
Since I saw her standing there

Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoah we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now Ill never dance with another Whooh
Since I saw her standing there

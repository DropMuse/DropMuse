Beatles
Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)

I once had a girl
Or should I say
She once had me

She showed me her room
Isnt it good
Norwegian wood

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasnt a chair

I sat on a rug
Biding my time
Drinking her wine

We talked until two
And then she said
Its time for bed

She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didnt
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke
I was alone
This bird had flown

So I lit a fire
Isnt it good
Norwegian wood

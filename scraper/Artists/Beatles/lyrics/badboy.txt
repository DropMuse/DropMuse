Beatles
Bad Boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts chewing gum in little girls hair
Hey junior behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now junior behave yourself

Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers laundramat
Well mamas head has got to stop
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now junior behave yourself

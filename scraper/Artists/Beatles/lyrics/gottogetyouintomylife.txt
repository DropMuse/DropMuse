Got To Get You Into My Life

I was alone I took a ride
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh then I suddenly see you
Ooh did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh you were meant to be near me
Ooh and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do what can I be
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh then I suddenly see you
Ooh did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone I took a ride
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day

Beatles
Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

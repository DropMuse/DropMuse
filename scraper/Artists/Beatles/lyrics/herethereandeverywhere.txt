Here, There And Everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here

Here making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I will be there and everywhere
Here there and everywhere

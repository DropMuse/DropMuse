I Don't Want To Spoil The Party

I dont want to spoil the party so Ill go
I would hate my disappointment to show
Theres nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while Im gone please let me know

Ive had a drink or two and I dont care
Theres no fun in what I do if shes not there
I wonder what went wrong Ive waited far too long
I think Ill take a walk and look for her

Though tonight shes made me sad
I still love her
If I find her Ill be glad
I still love her

I dont want to spoil the party so Ill go
I would hate my disappointment to show
Theres nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while Im gone please let me know

Though tonight shes made me sad
I still love her
If I find her Ill be glad
I still love her

Though Ive had a drink or two and I dont care
Theres no fun in what I do if shes not there
I wonder what went wrong Ive waited far too long
I think Ill take a walk and look for her

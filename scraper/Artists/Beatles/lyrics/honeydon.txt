Honey Don't

Well how come you say you will when you wont
Say you do baby when you dont
Let me know honey how you feel
Tell the truth now is love real
But ah ah well honey dont well honey dont
Honey dont honey dont honey dont
I say you will when you wont ah ah honey dont

Well I love you baby and you ought to know
I like the way you wear your clothes
Everything about you is so doggone sweet
You got that sand all over your feet
But ah ah well honey dont honey dont
Honey dont honey dont honey dont
I say you will when you wont ah ah honey dont

Ah rock on George one time for me

I feel fine
I said

Well sometimes I love you on a Saturday night
Sunday morning you dont look right
Youve been out painting the town
Ah ah baby been stepping around
But ah ah well honey dont I said honey dont
Honey dont honey dont honey dont
I say you will when you wont ah ah honey dont

Ah rock on George for Ringo one time
Well honey dont well honey dont
I say you will when you wont ah ah honey dont

Beatles
Do You Want To Know A Secret

Youll never know how much I really love you
Youll never know how much I really care

Listen
Do you want to know a secret
Do you promise not to tell whoa oh oh

Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
Im in love with you

Listen
Do you want to know a secret
Do you promise not to tell whoa oh oh

Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
Im in love with you

Ive known the secret for a week or two
Nobody knows just we two

Listen
Do you want to know a secret
Do you promise not to tell whoa oh oh

Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
Im in love with you

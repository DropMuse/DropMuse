Beatles
Don't Pass Me By

I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they dont arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I dont hear it
Does it mean you dont love me any more

I hear the clock are ticking
On the mantel shelf
See the hands are moving
But Im by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why Im by myself
I dont see you
Does it mean you dont love me any more

Dont pass me by dont make me cry dont make me blue
Cause you know darling I love only you
Youll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Dont pass me by dont make me cry dont make me blue

Im sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said thats alright Im waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you

Dont pass me by dont make me cry dont make me blue
Cause you know darling I love only you
Youll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Dont pass me by dont make me cry

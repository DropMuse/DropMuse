Beatles
I Call Your Name

I call your name but youre not there
Was I to blame for being unfair
Oh I cant sleep at night
Since youve been gone
I never weep at night
I cant go on

Dont you know I cant take it
I dont know who can
Im not goin to mayayake it
Im not that kind of man

Oh I cant sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name
Aww

Dont you know I cant take it
I dont know who can
Im not goin to mayayake it
Im not that kind of man

Oh I cant sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name
I call your name
I call your name
I call your name

All Things Must Pass

Sunrise doesnt last all morning
A cloudburst doesnt last all day
Seems my love is up
And has left you with no warning
But its not always going to be this grey

All things must pass
All things must pass away

Sunset doesnt last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this my love is up
And must be leaving
It has not always been this grey

All things must pass
All things must pass away

All things must pass
None of lifes strings can last
So I must be on my way
And face another day

Now the darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good
At arriving at the right time
Its not always going to be this grey

All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
All things must pass away

Beatles
So How Come (No One Loves Me)

They say that everyone wants someone
So how come no one wants me
And they say that eveyone needs someone
So how come no one needs me

Well if you wonder who the loneliest creatures in the world can be
Well theyre the ugly duckling the little black sheep and me
Uh huh
They say that everyone loves someone
So how come no one loves me

Well if you wonder who the loneliest creatures in the world can be
Well theyre the ugly duckling the little black sheep and me
Uh huh
They say that everyone loves someone
So how come no one loves me
So how come no one loves me
So how come no one loves me

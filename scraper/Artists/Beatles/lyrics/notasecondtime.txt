Beatles
Not A Second Time

You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

And now youve changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry its through oh

Youre giving me the same old line
Im wondering why
You hurt me then
Youre back again
No no no not a second time

You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you yea

And now youve changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry its through oh

Youre giving me the same old line
Im wondering why
You hurt me then
Youre back again
No no no not a second time
Not a second time
Not the second time
No no no no no
No no no

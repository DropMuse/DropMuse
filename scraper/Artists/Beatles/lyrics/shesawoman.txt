She's A Woman

My love dont give me presents
I know that shes no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love dont give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that shes only
Fooling I know she isnt

She dont give the boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her
She dont give the boys the eye
She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as
Loving dont ask me why

Shes a woman who understands
Shes a woman who loves her man

My love dont give me presents
I know that shes no peasant
Only ever has to give me love
Forever and forever
My love dont give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that shes only
Fooling I know she isnt

Shes a woman who understands
Shes a woman who loves her man

My love dont give me presents
I know that shes no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love dont give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that shes only
Fooling I know she isnt

Shes a woman shes a woman
Shes a woman shes a woman

You Know What To Do

When I see you
I just dont know what to say
I like to be with you
Every hour of the day
So if you want me
Just like I need you
You know what to do

I watched you walking by
And you looked alone
I hope that you wont mind
If I walk you back home
And if you want me
Just like I need you
You know what to do

Just call on me
When youre lonely
Ill keep my love
For you only
Ill call on you
If Im lonely too

Understand Ill stay
With you every day
Make you love me more
In every way
So if you want me
Just like I want you
You know what to do

Just call on me
When youre lonely
Ill keep my love
For you only
Ill call on you
If Im lonely too

Understand Ill stay
With you every day
Make you love me more
In every way
So if you want me
Just like I need you
You know what to do

I Want To Hold Your Hand

Oh yeah Ill tell you something
I think youll understand
When Ill say that something
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

Oh please say to me
Youll let me be your man
And please say to me
Youll let me hold your hand
Ill let me hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

And when I touch you I feel happy
Inside
Its such a feeling that my love
I cant hide
I cant hide
I cant hide

Yeah youve got that something
I think youll understand
When Ill say that something
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

And when I touch you I feel happy
Inside
Its such a feeling that my love
I cant hide
I cant hide
I cant hide

Yeah youve got that something
I think youll understand
When Ill feel that something
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

It Won't Be Long

It wont be long yeh yeh yeh
It wont be long yeh yeh yeh
It wont be long yeh till I belong to you

Every night when everybody has fun
Here am I sitting all on my own

It wont be long yeh yeh yeh
It wont be long yeh yeh yeh
It wont be long yeh till I belong to you

Since you left me Im so alone
Now youre coming youre coming on home
Ill be good like I know I should
Youre coming home youre coming home

Every night the tears come down from my eyes
Every day Ive done nothing but cry

It wont be long yeh yeh yeh
It wont be long yeh yeh yeh
It wont be long yeh till I belong to you

Since you left me Im so alone
Now youre coming youre coming on home
Ill be good like I know I should
Youre coming home youre coming home

So every day well be happy I know
Now I know that you wont leave me no more

It wont be long yeh yeh yeh
It wont be long yeh yeh
It wont be long yeh till I belong to you woo

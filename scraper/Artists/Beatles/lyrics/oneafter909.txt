One After 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice
I said Im travling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
Youre only fooling around youre fooling around with me
I said move over once move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice
I said Im travling on the one after 909

I got my bag run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice
I said Im travling on the one after 909

I got my bag run to the station
railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice
I said were travling on the one after 90
I said were travling on the one after 90
I said were travling on the one after 909

Oh Danny Boy the old summer is calling

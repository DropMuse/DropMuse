Beatles
The Long And Winding Road

The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear Ive seen that road before
It always leads me here lead me to your door
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here let me know the way

Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Any way youll never know the many ways Ive tried
And still they lead me back to the long winding road
You left me standing here a long long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here lead me to your door

But still they lead me back to the long winding road
You left me standing here a long long time ago
Dont keep me waiting here Dont keep me wait lead me to your door
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

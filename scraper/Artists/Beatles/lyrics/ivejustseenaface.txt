I've Just Seen A Face

Ive just seen a face
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just met
Shes just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
Weve met mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight didididindi

Falling yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

I have never known
The like of this Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this dadandadanda

Falling yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Falling yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Ive just seen a face
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just met
Shes just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
Weve met mmmmmmmmmdadada

Falling yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Falling yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Oh falling yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

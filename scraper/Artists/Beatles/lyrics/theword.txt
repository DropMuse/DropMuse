The Word

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love
Its so fine its sunshine
Its the word love

In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it the word is good

Spread the word and youll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love
Its so fine its sunshine
Its the word love

Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love
Its so fine its sunshine
Its the word love

Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
Its the word Im thinking of
And the only word is love
Its so fine its sunshine
Its the word love

Say the word love
Say the word love
Say the word love
Say the word love

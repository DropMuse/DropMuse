Yes It Is

If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is the color that my baby wore
And what is more its true
Yes it is

Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Everybody knows Ive sure
I could remember all the things we planned
Understand its true
Yes it is its true
Yes it is

I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her but its my pride
Yes it is yes it is
Oh yes it is yeah

Please dont wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you its true
Yes it is its true
Yes it is

I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her but its my pride
Yes it is yes it is
Oh yes it is yeah

Please dont wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you its true
Yes it is its true
Yes it is its true

A Taste Of Honey

A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine

I dream of your first kiss
And then I feel upon my lips again

A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine

I will return yes I will return
Ill come back for the honey and you

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still though were far apart

That taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine

Oh I will return yes I will return
Ill come back Hell come back 
for the honey For the honey 
and you

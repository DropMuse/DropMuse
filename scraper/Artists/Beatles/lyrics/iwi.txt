Beatles
I Will

Who knows how long Ive loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to I will

For if I ever saw you
I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh you know I will
I will

Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
Da da da da da da da

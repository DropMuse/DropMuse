Beatles
Love You To

Each day just goes so fast
I turn around its past
You dont get time to hang a sign on me

Love me while you can
Before Im a dead old man

A lifetime is so short
A new one cant be bought
But what youve got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Theres people standing round
Wholl screw you in the ground
Theyll fill you in with all their sins youll see

Ill make love to you
If you want me to

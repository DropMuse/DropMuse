Slow Down

Well come on pretty baby wont you walk with me
Come on pretty baby wont you talk with me
Come on pretty baby give me one more chance
Try to save our romance

Slow down baby now youre movin way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin gimme little lovin
Ow If you want our love to last

Well I used to walk you home baby after school
Carry your books home too
But now you got a boyfriend down the street
Baby what youre tryin to do

You better slow down
Baby now youre movin way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin gimme little lovin
Bbbbb If you want our love to last

Well you know that I love you tell the world I do
Come on pretty baby why cant you be true
I need your baby oh so bad
The best little woman I ever had

Slow down baby now youre movin way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin gimme little lovin
Ow If you want our love to last

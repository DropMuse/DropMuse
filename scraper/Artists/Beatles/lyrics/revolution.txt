Beatles
Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world

But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know that you can count me out

Dont you know its gonna be alright
Alright alright

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were all doing what we can

But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait

Dont you know its gonna be alright
Alright alright al

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
Youd better free your mind instead

But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow

Dont you know know its gonna be alright
Alright alright

Alright alright
Alright alright
Alright alright
Alright alright

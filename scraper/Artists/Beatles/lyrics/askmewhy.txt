Ask Me Why

I love you cause you tell me things I want to know
And its true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I I I I
Should never never never be blue

Now youre mine my happiness still makes me cry
And in time youll understand the reason why
If I cry its not because Im sad
But youre the only love that Ive ever had

I cant believe its happened to me
I cant conceive of any more misery

Ask me why Ill say I love you
And Im always thinking of you

I love you cause you tell me things I want to know
And its true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I I I I
Should never never never be blue

Ask me why Ill say I love you
And Im always thinking of you

I cant believe its happened to me
I cant conceive of any more misery

Ask me why Ill say I love you
And Im always thinking of you
You you

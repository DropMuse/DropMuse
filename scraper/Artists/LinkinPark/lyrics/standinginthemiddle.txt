Standing In The Middle

Im standing in the middle of it
Middle of it middle of it

Yo yall better wake up you think we dont see yall drifting
Sleeping on the job and forgetting your position
Position
Sit straight and listen what you are missing
I cook up a batch hot straight out the kitchen

No indecision I spit right
Heavy as a fist fight
No gloves and no masks
No pain and no slack
No way to look back

Nobody to say I cant make my own path
Cause the way that yall act I wanna break something
Comin at me like the pain I feel means nothing
Comin from a place where you cant relate

Where every word from your face comes across as fake
And I can hardly take the way that yall treat us
Sending this out to anyone who wont believe us
Spelling it out so yall know the deal
And if you cant feel it maybe you cant feel

Im standing in the middle of it
Middle of it middle of it
Man who are you
Im standing in the middle of it
Middle of it middle of it
What are you saying

Im standing in the middle of it
Middle of it middle of it
What are you writing
Im standing in the middle of it
Middle of it middle of it
Man who are you

Tell em Motion eat your words
Say what you used to say and act how you used to act
Every time you heard my occupation was a rap attack
Rap attack
My conversations stacked I switch my defense on you

Every time you want to get deep youll see my knuckle package
Born to die ferocious Emcee make you go back and write your rhymes
My style chokes up like a little league baseball player
It moves Im strangling as Im swinging as main mangler

I wanna deefour poach you as your seafood is ceefour
Im gonna rap and you still kneehigh
Yall wanna train with me guy Man its destructive
Man its like jabs from boxing champ Lennox

Perfect for your head Ill fit it like New Era hats
That top off suits Bboy etiquette
Express myself with my hangside
Then I extend one finger the middle fucking

Im standing in the middle of it
Middle of it middle of it
Man who are you
Im standing in the middle of it
Middle of it middle of it
What are you sayin

Im standing in the middle of it
Middle of it middle of it
What are you writin
Im standing in the middle of it
Middle of it middle of it
Man who are you

Yo Motion
Yeah
Sometimes I feel its like nothing that I ever do is ever good enough
For real
Like I should stop and go back to LA

Back away where I know I wont be seen
And nobodys gonna critique the music that I make
And mistake me for some fucking kid with a backpack
Rapping on a track just to make a buck

For a mixtape that sucks
And deejays that dont get it
But I been down that road and I know
People dont wanna go where I might go

Dont wanna know what its like
To step outside your zone with a mike
Just controlling the hype
And if we need to take shots from them

And be stopped by them just to make these ends
Then so be it I will not hold my breath
Im gonna spit til I got none left
Motion where you at

Im standing in the middle of it
Middle of it middle of it
Man who are you
Im standing in the middle of it
Middle of it middle of it
What are you sayin

Im standing in the middle of it
Middle of it middle of it
What are you writin
Im standing in the middle of it
Middle of it middle of it

Man who are you
Im standing in the middle of it
Middle of it middle of it
Middle of it middle of it

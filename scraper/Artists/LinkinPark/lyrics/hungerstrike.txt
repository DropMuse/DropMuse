Hunger Strike

I dont mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I cant feed on the powerless
When my cups already overfilled
But its on the table
The fire is cooking
And theyre farming babies
While slaves are working
Blood is on the table
And the mouths are choking
But Im growing hungry

I dont mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I cant feed on the powerless
When my cups already overfilled
But its on the table
The fires cooking
And theyre farming babies
While the slaves are all working
And its on the table
The mouths are choking
But Im growing hungry
Im going hungry

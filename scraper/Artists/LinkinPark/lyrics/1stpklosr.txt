Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause Im one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break

Im about to break
This room to breathe
This room to breathe
This room to breathe

I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything Ive said before
All these words they make no sence
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you say
Youll find that out anyway
I find the answers arent so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sence
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
Just like before

Everything you say to me
And Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And Im about to break

Everything you say to me
And Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And Im about to break

These are the places where I can feel torn from my body
My flesh it peels during this ride we can cut upwhat we like
Im about to break
Waiting alone I cannot resist
Feeling this hate I have never missed
Please someone give me a reason to rip off my face
Blood is a pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring
And pouring

Shut up when Im talking to you
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up when Im talking to you
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
Blood is pouring
Shut up
Im about to break

Everything you say to me
And Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And Im about to break

Everything you say to me
And Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And Im about to

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause Im one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause Im one step closer to the edge
And Im about to

The Little Things Give You Away

Water grey
Through the windows up the stairs

Chilling rain
Like an ocean everywhere

Chorus
Dont want to reach for me do you
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away

And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All youve ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you

And six feet under water
I
Do
End Chorus

Hope decays
Generations disappear

Washed away
As a nation simply stares

Chorus
Dont want to reach for me do you
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away

But now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All youve ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you

And six feet under water
I
Do

All youve ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you

And six feet under ground now
I
Now I do
End Chorus

Little things give you away
Little things give you away
Little things give you away
Little things give you away

All youve ever wanted Little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you Little things give you away

All youve ever wanted Little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you Little things give you away

All youve ever wanted Little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you Little things give you away

All youve ever wanted Little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you Little things give you away

All youve ever wanted Little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you Little things give you away

All youve ever wanted Little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you Little things give you away

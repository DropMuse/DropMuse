White Noise

Youve been taking it all this time
You left my trust on the firing line
As the promises break the only mistakes
Giving you what was mine
Your words are clear but their meanings gone
The notes are right but the tunings wrong
And when you tell me again that I should give in
I can only take it so long long long long

A 
Youre terrified terrified
Youd rather throw it all away all away
All away youre terrified terrified
Youd rather throw it all away

Fear is dancing inside your lies exposing secrets that youve disguised
And Im biting my tongue as you become victim of a compromise
Cause I know who you really are not a scratch where you can take a scar
And its time that you seek the truth without me 
I can only get you so far far far far

A
Youre terrified terrified
Youd rather throw it all away all away
All away youre terrified terrified
Youd rather throw it all away

Throw it all away all away all away

A
Youre terrified terrified
Youd rather throw it all away all away
All away youre terrified terrified
Youd rather throw it all away all away
All away youre terrified terrified
Youd rather throw it all away all away
All away youre terrified terrified
Youd rather throw it all away

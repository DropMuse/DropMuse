Apaches (Until It Breaks Demo, No. 1)

It goes a one two three

I was born with the hunger of a lion the strength of a sun
I dont need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I dont run the track no I make the track run
My mama taught me words my dad he built rockets
I put em both together now tell me what I got its
A pretty smart weapon I can shoot it I can drop it
But learn to respect it cause you clearly cant stop it
Like that
It aint over cause the sharks on the left side the snakes on the right
And anything you do they wanna get a little bite
It really doesnt matter if youre wrong or if youre right
Cause once you get the teeth in nothing really fights
Except for me I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier I aint standing next to you
Id be laying on the ground before youre even in my view
Like that

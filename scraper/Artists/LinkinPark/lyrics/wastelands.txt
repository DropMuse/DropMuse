LinkinPark
Wastelands

This is war with no weapons
Marching with no stepping
Murder with no killing
Illing every direction
First no sequel
do the math No equal
John with no Yoko
More power less people
And no Im not afraid of that
Print in your paperback
Every rap is made in fact
To act as a delayed attack
Every phrase a razor blade
Thats saved until they play it back
To slay and leave em laying on the pavement
Bang
Fade to black

In the wastelands of today
When theres nothing left to lose
And and theres nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today

Roll credits to get it
The shows done
Theyre talking for just talking
But meaning they got none
None of em come proper
They talk like a shotgun
But how many got bred with integrity
Not one
So no Im not afraid to see these suckers hold a blade to me
Aint a way to shake the ground I built before you came to be
Take it how you take it Im the opposite of vacancy
And this is not negotiation yall can hate and
And wait and see

In the wastelands of today
When theres nothing left to lose
And and theres nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
And your hope turns into fear

In the wastelands of today

In the wastelands of today
When theres nothing left to lose
And and theres nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today

In the wastelands of today
In the wastelands of today

Step Up

Watch as the room rocks
Mentally moonwalk
Mixed media slang
Banging in your boom box verbal violence
Lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip hop rhymes are childish
You cant tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rapping to a beat doesnt make you an MC
With your lack of skill and facility
Youre killing me
And a DJ in the group just for credibility
I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes
Youre not an emcee if someone else writes your lines
And rapping over rock doesnt make you a pioneer
Cause rock and hip hop have collaborated for years
But now theyre getting randomly mixed and matched up
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up None of its real
You want to be an emcee youve got to study the skill

Who can rock a rhyme like this
Bring it to you every time like this
Who can rock a rhyme like this
Step step up step step up

So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
But mentally you dont have the hip hop energy
With a tendency to make up stories
Sounding like the only hip hop youve heard is top 40
And your record company is completely missing it
All the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate
So in a battle you cant hack it
React with whack shit
And get smacked with verbal back flips
Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
Its taken decades for emcees to establish this
Youre new to hip hop and welcome if your serious
But not on the mic
Leave that to the experienced

Using the waves of sound the true master paralyzes his opponents leaving him
vulnerable to attack

Chorus 2x

After years of pain staking research by the worlds leading sound scientists we
here at the sound institute have invented a reliable audio weapons system Actual
movement of musical sound in space used to carefully attack and neutralize the
cellular structure of the human body and the question must be asked

Chorus 2x

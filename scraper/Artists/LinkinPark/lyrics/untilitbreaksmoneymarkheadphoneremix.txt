Until It Breaks (Money Mark Headphone Remix)

It goes a one
It goes a one two three

I was born with the hunger of a lion the strength of a sun
I dont need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I dont run the track no I make the track run
My mama taught me words my dad he built rockets
I put em both together now tell me what I got its
A pretty smart weapon I can shoot it I can drop it
But learn to respect it cause you clearly cant stop it
Like that
It aint over cause the sharks on the left side the snakes on the right
And anything you do they wanna get a little bite
It really doesnt matter if youre wrong or if youre right
Cause once you get the teeth in nothing really fights
Except for me I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier I aint standing next to you
Id be laying on the ground before youre even in my view
Like that

Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring
The poor men sing
Bring me to kingdom come

This is something for your people on the block to black out and rock to
Give you whatcha need like Poppa who shot ya
Separate the weak from the obsolete
Youre meek I creep hard on imposters
And switch styles on a dime quick witted
Yall quit tripping I dont have time for your crying
I grind tough sucka make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the lineup
Bang bang little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain
I aint playing Im just saying
You aint gotta sliver of a chance
I get iller I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake shake down money heres the break down
You can play the bank Imma play the bank take down
And no mistakes now Im coming to getcha
Im just a Banksy youre a Brainwash get the picture
Its like that

We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more
So rest your head its time to sleep
And dream of whats in store
The body bends until it breaks
Then sings again no more
Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning sings no more

Nobodyâ€™s Listening

Yo peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is how could you ignore it
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
With raps that got you backing this up like
Rewind that were just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these nonstop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven
But in the meantime there are those who wanna talk this and that
So I suppose that it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt 

it goes

Chorus
Tried to give you warning but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobodys listening
Called to you so clearly but you dont want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobodys listening

I got a heart full of pain head full of stress
handfull of anger held in my chest
And everything lefts a waste of time
I hate my rhymes but hate everyone elses more
Im riding on the back of this pressure
Guessing that its better I cant keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on
Never forget the blood sweat and tears
The uphill struggle over years the fear and
Trash talking and the people it was to
And the people that started it just like you

Chorus
Tried to give you warning but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobodys listening
Called to you so clearly but you dont want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobodys listening

I got a heart full of pain head full of stress
handfull of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle
Blood sweat and tears
Nothing to gain
Everything to fear

Heart full of pain head full of stress
handfull of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle
Blood sweat and tears
Nothing to gain
Everything to fear

Heart full of pain

Chorus
Tried to give you warning but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobodys listening
Called to you so clearly but you dont want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobodys listening

I got a heart full of pain head full of stress
Nobodys listening
handfull of anger held in my chest
Nobodys listening
Uphill struggle
Blood sweat and tears
Nobodys listening
Nothing to gain
Everything to fear
Nobodys listening

Coming at you from every side

Burning In The Skies

I used the deadwood to make the fire rise
The blood of innocence burning in the skies
I filled my cup with the rising of the sea
And poured it out in an ocean of debris

Im swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So dont apologize
Im losing what I dont deserve
What I dont deserve

We held our breath when the clouds began to form
But you were lost in the beating of the storm
And in the end we were made to be apart
In separate chambers of the human heart

Im swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So dont apologize
Im losing what I dont deserve

Its in the blackened bones
Of bridges I have burned
So dont apologize
Im losing what I dont deserve
What I dont deserve

Im swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So dont apologize
Im losing what I dont deserve

The blame is mine alone
For bridges I have burned
So dont apologize
Im losing what I dont deserve

What I dont deserve
What I dont deserve
What I dont deserve

And heres the dead wood to make the fire rise
The blood of innocence burning in the skies

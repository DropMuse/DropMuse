Stick N' Move

This is how its done going for the title and crown 
Renound MCs surround as the beat breaks down 
In 2 elements clobbin up those that have been blessed 
And its the MI see the way it ought to be ponessed 
Yes yes am I the one to keep you on your toes 
MostDefinitely in my bboy pose its theelectric boogie with the slight twist 
Touch your chin to your chest to the rhythm like this 

Now see what I have I want you 
Be with me or Stick n Move 
Now see what I had I want you 
Be with me or Stick n Move 

MCs dogging me since the first day I grabbed the mic 
Now its like You Sit You Stay 
Cobra path lifestyles Im kickin 
Stickin MCs real quick cause times tickin 
At the drop of the defense I let loose the venom 
Sendin I shot of verbal heat up in em
The ending will come grab your family and run 
Apocalyptic rhyme pattern taking shots from the sun 
Record in the world fourthousandeightyone 
Question my intentions and your whole world is done 
Like wars to Rome turn your eyeballs into Saturn 
Full metal jacket fully auto rhyme pattern 

Now see what I have I want you 
Be with me or Stick n Move 
Now see what I had I want you 
Be with me or Stick n Move 

Stick it rock it for a click and a whickett 
Move it moving all the tunes and you groove it 
Stick it rock it for a click and a whickett 
Move it moving all the tunes and you groove it 
Stick it rock it for a click and a whickett 
Move it moving all the tunes and you groove it 
Stick it rock it for a click and a whickett 
Move it moving all the tunes and you groove it 

Now see what I have I want you 
Be with me or Stick n Move 
Now see what I had I want you 
Be with me or Stick n Move

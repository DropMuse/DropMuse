LinkinPark
And One

Where should I start
Disjointed heart
Ive got no commitment
To my own flesh and blood
Left all alone
Far from my home
No one to hear me to heal my ill heart I

Keep it locked up inside

Cannot express
To the point Ive regressed
If angers a gift then I guess Ive been blessed I

Keep it locked up inside
Keep my distance from your lies

Its too late to love me now
You helped me to show me
Its too late to love me now
You dont even know me

Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Breaking a part of my heart to find release Break
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace Me
Breaking a part of my heart to find release Too
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Keep it locked up inside
Keep my distance from your lies

Breaking a part of my heart to find release Break
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace Me
Breaking a part of my heart to find release Too
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release 
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace 
Breaking a part of my heart to find release 
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance

music slows to rap solo

Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness
Cryptic colloquialism shifts your midrift
Dark all I do embark the shadows
Involved with my thought catalog analogue rap catalog
Keep my distance and fear resistance hurt by persistance
The twisted web of tangled lies
Strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste
And Im forced to face these hate crimes
Against the state of being 
Feeling the weightlessness pressed between the ceiling
Reeling around room
Riding a bubble of sound proof
Its the frequency making you
ShaShake with every boom
Involuntary muscle contraction
Ignoring and drinking musical gas fueled euphoria
The sound pounds to make the dead flush
To have you a head rush with red thoughts and said stuff

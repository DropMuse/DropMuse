Breaking The Habit (Original Mike 2002 Demo)

Down on the floor
Back behind the door
I try to catch my breath again
I cant ignore
Whats back behind the door
Wondering whats next again

I can say that youre the one
That battles always choose
But sometimes I realize
That Im the one confused

I dont know what were fighting for
Or why we have to scream
I dont know why I instigate
And say what I dont mean
I dont know how we got this way
I know its not alright
So Im breaking the habit
Im breaking the habit tonight

Memories consume pacing in the room
Cleaning broken glass again
Suddenly soon youre leaving from the room
Its happening so fast again

I can say that youre the one
That battles always choose
But sometimes I realize
That Im the one confused

I dont know what were fighting for
Or why we have to scream
I dont know why I instigate
And say what I dont mean
I dont know how we got this way
I know its not alright
So Im breaking the habit
Im breaking the habit tonight

Crashing into walls
It never was your fault
So here we are again
And this is how it ends

I dont know what were fighting for
Or why we have to scream
I dont know why I instigate
And say what I dont mean
I dont know how we got this way
I know its not alright
So Im breaking the habit
Im breaking the habit
Im breaking the habit tonight

Skin To Bone (Nick Catchdubs Remix)

Cody B Ware
This is that post apoc post Pac
Punks on the block
Supposed to be close
But I swear right now
They close to be not
Put the gold in the pot
Put em on bring em on
Nigga hope that they drop
But I bomb on them all
On with their the bongs
They be hopin I pop
You open the knot
You openly admittin you not
You openly be spittin shit you dont be givin a lot
You all be givers givin these women the rings and the style
Im Michael Tyson Bison relivin the villainous plot
My vision of rock my vision is caught
Killer cobra Nestce pas
Feel us a who feela real is enough
Im callin your bluff
Ill slaughter all your borders you trust
They wont be carryin your orders automatically dust
Im automatically rush plus grammatically tough
Trust the elephant tusk trunk and go for the top
Punk who want it
Im guaranteed to get it and flaunt it
Im playin Buckley as my intro and I exit on ballin

Skin to bone  steel to rust
Ash to ashes  dust to dust
Will tomorrow have its way
With the promises we made
Skin to bone  steel to rust

Ryu
You cant stop it all you can do it watch it while its happenin
Like a tragic accident rappers go and get your coffin
Skin to bone the high raw biff of this rap shit
My legacy set in stone fo sho no asterisk
Concept immaculate start to finish
Im Lil Waynes dentist looking at platinum plaques Im gettin
Its not an accident you flew off the roof
You said you was fly so I just wanna see if its true
I got the juice like GQ but I wish it was Grey Goose
Let it mix with my prescriptions and I turn into Keith Moon
A T two Terminator Demigod Jesus
Fort Minor We Major lets take it to phase two
The mission isnt finished yet I been on the internet
Hearin fans talk and maybe we should consider it

Skin to bone and steel to rust
Skin to bone and steel to rust

Im on some taxidermy rap shit talk about some raw game
Youre nothing but a trophy mounted on my door frame
I spit that propane light you with a slow flame
And watch you burn until theres nothin but a gold chain
Yeah youll be some crispy critters
Youll wish you with us
Youll wish what we did you did it
You cant you kiddin I dont have a shoe you fit in
Youre as soft as a motherfuckin newborn kitten
Im an animal tearing flesh into bone
Randomly rippin everything gone
Unless they forget what then let it be known
Ill bury every competitor every predator
Anyone ever forget it youll regret it forever
Never been nothing short of a legend you peasants will learn
Ill stay standin in the front like Im forgetting my turn
For these matchstick rappers this is meeting adjourned
I aint even gotta match them Im just letting them burn

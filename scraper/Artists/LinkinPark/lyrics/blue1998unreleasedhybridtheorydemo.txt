Blue (1998 Unreleased Hybrid Theory Demo)

In the dark days Ill part ways with the blame
Trying to maintain but its still all the same Its all a game
Hear my name in the rain and the pain Im wearing my face with a tear stain
Your faint fondness honestly its time to give you a piece of my mind and show you that youre blind
And in the design of the world I called mine know that you cant stand on both sides of the line

Everything is my fault
Its all the same just pass me the blame
The problems have two faces

Everything is my fault
Its all the same just pass me the blame
The problems have two faces

Everything is my fault
Its all the same just pass me the blame
The problems have two faces
Pass all the blame over to me it will come eventually
Take the time out to examine all these questions honestly

With my eyes shut Im seeing the truth in your words
Theyre absurd slurred into beauty to be heard
You swim through deceit the lies that you tell
The stories you sell knowing you well I keep distance
And every instance you keep your thoughts concealed
What I feel just another spoke in the wheel
Kneel here or nothing thrown down and trembled by your ego
And eaten away by my own version of the real

Everything is my fault
Its all the same just pass me the blame
The problems have two faces

Everything is my fault
Its all the same just pass me the blame
The problems have two faces

Pass all the blame over to me it will come eventually
Take the time out to examine all these questions honestly

Whos to blame

Nothing thrown down
Its all the same just pass me the blame
Trampled by your heel
Play the game and win a tear stain
Eaten by my own
Pass the blame cause youll feel it if you dont
Version of the real

Nothing thrown down
Its all the same just pass me the blame
Trampled by your heel
Play the game and win a tear stain
Eaten by my own
Pass the blame cause youll feel it if you dont
Version of the real

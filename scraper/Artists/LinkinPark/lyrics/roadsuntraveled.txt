Roads Untraveled

Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left alone
Cause beyond every bend
Is a long blinding end
Its the worst kind of pain
Ive known

Give up your heart left broken
And let that mistake pass on
Cause the love that you lost
Wasnt worth what it cost
And in time youll be glad its gone

Woahooohoh
Woahooohh
Woahooohoh
Woahooohh

Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end
And if you need a friend
Theres a seat here alongside me

Woahooohoh
Woahooohh
Woahooohoh
Woahooohh

Forfeit the game
before somebody else takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You cant run the race
The pace is to fast
You just wont last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life My pride is broken

Forfeit the game
before somebody else takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You cant run the race
The pace is to fast
You just wont last
Forfeit the game
before somebody else takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You cant run the race
The pace is to fast
You just wont last

I wont believe a word you say
Ill cut to pieces by the sound of every breath you take
Swimming through a sea of hurt
My life My pride is stronger

Forfeit the game
before somebody else takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You cant run the race
The pace is to fast
You just wont last
Forfeit the game
before somebody else takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You cant run the race
The pace is to fast
You just wont last

Its time to sink or swim
Its time to sink or swim
Its time to sink or swim
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim
Its time to sink or swim
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim
Its time to sink or swim
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim

Forfeit the game
before somebody else takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You cant run the race
The pace is to fast
You just wont last
Forfeit the game
before somebody else takes you outta the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You cant run the race
The pace is to fast
You just wont last

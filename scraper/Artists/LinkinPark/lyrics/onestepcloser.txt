One Step Closer

I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything Ive said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less youll say
Youll find that out anyway

Just like before

Chorus
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause Im one step closer to the edge
Im about to break

I find the answers arent so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

Just like before

Chorus

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause Im one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break

Shut up when Im talking to you
Shut up shut up shut up
Shut up when Im talking to you
Shut up shut up shut up shut up

Im about to BREAK

Chorus

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause Im one step closer to the edge
And Im about to break

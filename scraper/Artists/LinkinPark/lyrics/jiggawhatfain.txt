Jigga what

You gon need a vocal in right

Motherfuckers wanna act loco hit em wit numerous
shots with the fofo
Faggots wanna talk to PoPos smoke em like cocoa
Fuck rap coke by the boatload
Fuck dat on the runby gun high one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshittin glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga layin shocked when the bullet hit
Oh hey ma how you know niggaz wanna buy you
But see me I wanna Fuck for Free like Akinyele
Now I gotta let her take this ride make you feel it
inside your belly if its tight get the KY Jelly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side til you say JayZ youre too much for me

I am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I cant help the fact that everyone can see
these scars
I am what I want you to want what I want you to feel
But its like no matter what I do I cant convince you to just believe
this is real
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that Im not
But Ill be here cause youre all that I got

Got a condo with nuttin but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex imagine how I stroke
See how I was flowin on my last cassette
Rapidfire like Im blastin a Tec never jam though
Never get high never run out of ammo
Niggaz hatin n shit cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite I know it made you sick
And now youre actin raw but you never had war
Dont know how to carry your hoe wanna marry your hoe
Now shes mad at me causer Your Majesty just happened to be
A pimp with a tragedy
She wanted us to end cause I fucked with friends
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in I said Shit
theres a draft shut the door bitch and come on in

I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
Cause you dont understand I do what I can but sometimes I dont make
sense
I am what you never wanna say but Ive never had a doubt
Its like no matter what I do I cant convince you for once just to hear
me out
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that Im not
But Ill be here cause youre all that Ive got

I cant feel the way I did before
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored
Time wont heal this damage anymore
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored

No
Hear me out now
Youre gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now
Hear me out now
Youre gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now

I cant feel the way I did before
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored

I cant feel the way I did before
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored
Time wont heal this damage anymore
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored

I cant feel
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored
Time wont heal
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored

What We Don't Know (2007 Demo)

If everything would just stop
Then maybe I could collect my thoughts
If everything would stand still
I couldve hidden how lost I feel

I shouldve said what I hear
I shouldve let myself fear
I shouldve made myself clear

So this is how we fall apart
This is how the ending starts
And when we find weve lost our minds
We fake what we dont know

I never asked to let go
I never thought I could sink so low
I never let myself down
Until the second I did right now

I shouldve said what I hear
I shouldve let myself fear
I shouldve made myself clear

So this is how we fall apart
This is how the ending starts
And when we find weve lost our minds
We fake what we dont know

This is how we fall apart
This is how the ending starts
And when our heads betray our hearts
We fake what we dont know

Cause all we are is everything weve done
All we are is how quickly we run
And all we are
We are

This is how we fall apart
But this is how beginnings start
Cause when our heads betray our hearts
We fake what we dont know

And if our doubt begins again
The answers find us in the end
So in the meantime well pretend
And fake what we dont know

This is how we fall apart
But this is how beginnings start
Cause when our heads betray our hearts
We fake what we dont know

And if our doubt begins again
The answers find us in the end
So in the meantime well pretend
And fake what we dont know

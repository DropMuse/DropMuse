LinkinPark
Faint (2002 Demo)

Back before I said goodbye
Just as the first day turned to night
Just as the concrete turned to dust
And the steel turned into rust
All I could think was I need a way to dig through the damage
Couldnt think of a way to get through this
Now I see you takin advantage
And I found another reason to do this

Im diggin us a hole to travel through
I wanna find a way to rattle you
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit
Youre gonna have to follow me under it
Let go its begun
Close your eyes Im not done
Breathe a word and waste your breath
And keep it up till theres nothing left

Now that I said goodbye
Just as the darkness turned to light
Just as the next light turns to day
And the world gets underway
All I can see is the anticipation
Waiting to take this out on the wind and the raindrops
And I waited patiently taking it in
Ready for the first of the face offs

Im diggin us a hole to travel through
I wanna find a way to rattle you
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit
Youre gonna have to follow me under it
Let go its begun
Close your eyes Im not done
Breathe a word and waste your breath
And keep it up till theres nothing left

Im diggin us a hole to travel through
I wanna find a way to rattle you
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit
Youre gonna have to follow me under it

Im diggin us a hole to travel through
I wanna find a way to rattle you
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit
Youre gonna have to follow me under it

Im diggin us a hole to travel through
I wanna find a way to rattle you
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit
Youre gonna have to follow me under it
Let go its begun
Close your eyes Im not done
Breathe a word and waste your breath
And keep it up till theres nothing left

NO

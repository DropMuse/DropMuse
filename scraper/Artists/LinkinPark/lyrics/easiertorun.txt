Easier To Run

Its easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
Its so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Something has been taken from deep inside of me
The secret Ive kept locked away no one can ever see
Wounds so deep they never show they never go away
Like moving pictures in my head for years and years theyve played

If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would
If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

Chorus
Its easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
Its so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories I wish I didnt have
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back
And never moving forward so thered never be a past

If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would
If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

Just washing it aside
All of the helplessness inside
Pretending I dont feel misplaced
Its so much simpler than change

Chorus
Its easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
Its so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Its easier to run
If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made
Its easier to go
If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

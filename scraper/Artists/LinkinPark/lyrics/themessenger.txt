The Messenger

When you feel youre alone
Cut off from this cruel world
Your instincts telling you to run

Listen to your heart
Those angel voices
Theyll sing to you
Theyll be your guide
Back home

When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
It keeps us kind

When youve suffered enough
And your spirit is breaking
Youre growing desperate from the fight

Remember youre loved
And you always will be
This melody will bring you right
Back home

When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind

Ohhhhhh Ohhhhhhh
Ohhhhhh Ohhhhhhh
Ohhhhhh Ohhhhhhh

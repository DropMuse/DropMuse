Starting To Fly

I know the answers from the words of
The prophet
Ive seen the light through the fingers
Made of magic

Ive seen an image of the future
Its a vision and I know who you are

Chorus
Go away cant you see youre not real
Open your eye some place far away
Ive seen the ocean and Ive seen the sky
Ive got my wings and Im starting to fly

I met a poet tonight behind the masses
I sang a song about my many true
Addictions
I saw myself in a hole down below
And I know who you are

Chorus
Im alright though its hard to feel
Open your eye some place far away
Ive seen the ocean and Ive seen the sky
Ive got my wings and Im starting to fly

oh yeah oh yeah

Open your eyes
Look to the sky
Grab your wings
And then start to fly
2x

Chorus
Ive seen the ocean and Ive seen the sky
Ive got my wings and Im starting to fly
2x

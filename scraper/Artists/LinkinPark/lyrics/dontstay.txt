LinkinPark
Don't Stay

Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes I need you to stay away from me
Sometimes Im in disbelief I didnt know
Somehow I need you to go

Chorus
Dont stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and
Dont stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and
Dont stay

Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself
Sometimes Im in disbelief I didnt know
Somehow I need to be alone

Chorus 

I dont need you anymore I dont want to be ignored
I dont need one more day of you wasting me away
I dont need you anymore I dont want to be ignored
I dont need one more day of you wasting me away

With no apologies

Chorus 

Dont stay

Dont stay

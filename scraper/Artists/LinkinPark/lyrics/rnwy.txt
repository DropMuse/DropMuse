Gra
Grafitti sky

I dont think youre all ready
Yo I dont think youre all ready

Grafitti decourations
Under a sky of grey
This constant apprehension
Still giving me away
The lessons Ive forgotten
In spite of all Ive learned
Now I find myself in question
Point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
Point the finger at me again

I want to runaway I want to runaway
I want to know the truth I want to know the truth
I want to know the answers I want to know the answers
I want to shut the door
And open up my mind

Paperbags and angry voices
Under a sky of grey
This constant apprehension
Wont seem to go away
All my talk of starting over
These words were never true
Now I find myself in question
Point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
Point the finger at me again

I want to run away I want to runaway
I want to know the truth I want to know the truth
I want to know the answers I want to know the answers
I want to shut the door
And open up my mind

Going to runaway
Going to runaway way
Going to runaway
Going to runaway way way
Going to runaway

Hey yall not ready
Hey yo

I dont think yall ready for what Im about to do
All you newskool dudes aint even got no clue
How dare you forget about Bam and Zue Lue
Cool Herc and Jazzy J
They paved the way
Let me spit it for yall who said I wasnt going to make it
Every time I blaze it yall the first to hate it
My team reigns supreme to stay strong
Got the true series son
They scared to put us on
Cant get with hybrids
Get off your hiatus
To many yalls dying for it
So I got to blaze it
Still ripping BK Brooklyn B and on
Hellfighting family aliennation
Banging hits in the backyard while LPs on
Im a little communicate
Phoenix Orion

I want to runaway I want to runaway
I want to know the truth I want to know the truth
I want to know the answers I want to know the answers
I want to shut the door
And open up my mind

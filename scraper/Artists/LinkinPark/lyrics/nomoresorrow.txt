No More Sorrow

Are you lost
In your lies
Do you tell yourself I dont realize

Your crusades a disguise
Replace freedom with fear
You trade money for lives

Im aware of what youve done

Chorus
No No more sorrow
Ive paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

I see pain
I see need
I see liars and thieves
Abuse power with greed

I had hope
I believed
But Im beginning to think that Ive been deceived

You will pay for what youve done

Chorus

Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites

Chorus x2

Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be erased

Breaking The Habit

Memories consume
Like opening the wound
Im picking me apart again
You all assume
Im safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

PreChorus
I dont want to be the one
The battles always choose
Cause inside I realize
That Im the one confused

Chorus
I dont know whats worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I dont know why I instigate
And say what I dont mean
I dont know how I got this way
I know its not alright
So Im
Breaking the habit
Im breaking the habit
Tonight

Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more
Than anytime before
I had no options left again

PreChorus
I dont want to be the one
The battles always choose
Cause inside I realize
That Im the one confused

Chorus
I dont know whats worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I dont know why I instigate
And say what I dont mean
I dont know how I got this way
Ill never be alright
So Im breaking the habit
Im breaking the habit
Tonight

Bridge
Ill paint it on the walls
Cause Im the one at fault
Ill never fight again
And this is how it ends

Chorus
I dont know whats worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
To show you what I mean
I dont know how I got this way
Ill never be alright
So Im breaking the habit
Im breaking the habit
Im breaking the habit
Tonight

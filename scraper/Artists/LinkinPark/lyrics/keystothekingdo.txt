Keys To The Kingdom

Chester
No control No surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
Im my own casualty I fuck up everything I see fighting in futility

Mike
We start the Final War
Tell me whats worth fighting for
When we know theres nothing more
We take the hand or fist
Just to sell ourselves for this
The path we least resist

Chester Screams

Chester
No control No surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
Im my own casualty I fuck up everything I see fighting in futility

Mike
Uh I give you what you came for
This is not the same though
Got a different method
But I still can bring the pain so
Yall stuck in that same flow
I got that insane flow
High as yall can get but youre
Never really in my range though
Yes Im half Anglo
Half fried Panko
All primetime rhymer
Let the bass bang low
All you fucking lames go
Aiming at my name know
Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for
Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for

Chester
No control No surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
Im my own casualty I fuck up everything I see fighting in futility

Instrumental Break

Chester
No control No surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
Im my own casualty x2

Kid

Mike

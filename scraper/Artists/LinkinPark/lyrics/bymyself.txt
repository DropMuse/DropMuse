By Myself

What do I do to ignore them behind me
Do I follow my instincts blindly
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them redhanded
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness
Because I cant hold on when Im stretched so thin
I make the right moves but Im lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again
By myself myself

x2
I ask why but in my mind
I find I cant rely on myself

Chorus
I cant hold on
To what I want when Im stretched so thin
Its all too much to take in
I cant hold on
To anything watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I
Turn my back Im defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on then theyll
Take from me till everything is gone
If I let them go Ill be outdone
But if I try to catch them Ill be outrun
If Im killed by the questions like a cancer
Then Ill be buried in the silence of the answer
by myself myself

x2
I ask why but in my mind
I find I cant rely on myself

Chorus

How do you think Ive lost so much
Im so afraid that Im out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know Is what you tell me to

x2
Dont you know
I cant tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do how hard I try
I cant seem to convince myself why
Im stuck on the outside

Chorus x2

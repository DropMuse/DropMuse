Rebellion

Ive seen the blood
Ive seen the broken
The lost and the sights unseen
I want a flood
I want an ocean
To wash my confusion clean

I cant resolve this empty story
I cant repair the damage done

We are the fortunate ones
Whove never faced oppressions gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion

We acted out
We wear the colors
Confined by the things we own
Were not without
Were like each other
Pretending were here alone

And far away they burn their buildings
Right in the face of the damage done

We are the fortunate ones
Whove never faced oppressions gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion
Rebellion rebellion rebellion

Rebellion rebellion
We lost before the start
Rebellion rebellion
One by one we fall apart
We fall apart
We fall apart
We fall apart

We are the fortunate ones
Whove never faced oppressions gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of imitations of
We are the fortunate ones
Whove never faced oppressions gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion
Rebellion rebellion rebellion

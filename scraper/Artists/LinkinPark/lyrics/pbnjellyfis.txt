PB N' Jellyfish

Aone atwo aone two three four
Uh this songs about jellyfish
And their bellyfish
Aint no foolyfish
I dont droolyfish
Goes like this

Jelly jelly jellyfish
When you squeeze me I go squish
Peanut butter jellyfish
Put me onto your sandwich

Said jelly jelly jellyfish
When you squeeze me I go squish
Cause Im a jellyfish
Im a jellyfish

My friends are fish and they go to school
They think Im crazy and they think Im cool
Cause Im a jellyfish
Im a jellyfish

Jelly jelly jellyfish
When you squeeze me I go squish
Cause Im a jellyfish
Im a jellyfish

Got no eyes I got no head
Ive got no house I got no bed
Cause Im a jellyfish
Im a jellyfish
Jellyfish

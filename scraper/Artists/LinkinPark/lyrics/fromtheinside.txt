From The Inside

I dont know who to trust no surprise
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies
Trying not to break but Im so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this
All the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

Chorus
Take everything from the inside and throw it all away
Cause I swear for the last time I wont trust myself with you

Tension is building inside steadily
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me
Trying not to break but Im so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this
All the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

Chorus
Take everything from the inside and throw it all away
Cause I swear for the last time I wont trust myself with you

I wont waste myself on you
You
You
Waste myself on you
You
You

Ill take everything from the inside and throw it all away
Cause I swear for the last time I wont trust myself with you

Everything from the inside and just throw it all away
Cause I swear for the last time I wont trust myself with you
You
You

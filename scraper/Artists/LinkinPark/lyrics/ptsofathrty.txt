Yo yo
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
Puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You cant run the race
The pace is too fast
You just wont last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life my pride is broken

You like to think youre never wrong
You like to think youre never wrong
You have to act like youre someone
You have to act like youre someone
You want someone to hurt like you 
You want someone to hurt like you
You want to share what youve been through
You live what youve learned

You love the things I say Ill do
The way Ill hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life my pride is broken

You like to think youre never wrong 
You like to think youre never wrong
You have to act like youre someone 
You have to act like youre someone
You want someone to hurt like you 
You want someone to hurt like you
You want to share what youve been through
You live what youve learned

Yo yo
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
Puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You cant run the race
The pace is too fast
You just wont last

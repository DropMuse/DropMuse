Roads Untraveled (Rad Omen Remix)

Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left alone
Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
Its the worst kind of pain Ive known

Give up your heart left broken
And let that mistake pass on
Cause the love that you lost wasnt worth what it cost
And in time youll be glad its gone

Well its our life and its our time and its our place and its our choice
These are all our thoughts with our views out of our minds with our voice
Its our oath to this generation they call it fake we call it fate
You see they dont like us or understand us and they just hope we all fall away
But we wont stop and we wont quit and we wont settle for what they give
And well keep on standin keep on fightin no backin down thats how were livin
Our minds are made up and were focused no more believin what weve been told
Cause our bags are packed theres no turnin back we walk alone on these winding roads

Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end and if you need a friend
Theres a seat here alongside me

May your love never end and if you need a friend
Theres a seat here alongside me

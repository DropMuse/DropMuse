One Perfect Something

It was nothing but a fantasy I knew it
But I had a lot of fun before I blew it
Isnt that what everybody says
That you cant eat the cake if you piss on it

I put my money on a card roulette
And I kept my smile as I placed my bet
I knew what I did when I went on the ride
Its a 5align credit on the wild side

You showed me how
It was too good to be true
And that I should grow up
And start sniffing the glue

But its all around me
To the left and the right
And its eating me up
And spitting me out

If youve never seen a failure
then heres one
I was doomed before I ever begun
I was on board drinking
When titanic went down
And the band played on as I ordered a round

Thats just how it goes
Dont you think I know
You dont have to tell it to my face tell it to my face

I wont stop the show
I just let it flow
You dont have to tell it to my face tell it to my face

I dont ever want to stand in line you get it
Cause I could find a better waste of time you bet it
Everybody wants a piece of the pie
So I take what I want and I never ask why

If you wondered what would make me up
Then youll self combust if you smell the glove
Im a time bomb running out of batteries
And with fellows like you
I dont need no enemies

Thats just how it goes
Dont you think I know
You dont have to tell it to my face tell it to my face

I wont stop the show
I just let it flow
You dont have to tell it to my face tell it to my face

Thats just how it goes
Dont you think I know
You dont have to tell it to my face tell it to my face

I wont stop the show
I just let I flow
You dont have to tell it to my face tell it to my face

Thats just how it goes
Dont you think I know
You dont have to tell it to my face tell it to my face

I wont stop the show
I just let it flow
you dont have to tell it to my face tell it to my face

Tell it to my face
Tell it to my face
Tell it to my face

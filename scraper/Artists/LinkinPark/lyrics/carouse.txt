LinkinPark
Carousel

She cant hide no matter how hard she tries
Her secret disguised behind the lies
And at night she cries away her pride
With eyes shut tight staring at her inside
All her friends know why she cant sleep at night
All her family asking if shes alright
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell
Well all shes got to do is stop kidding herself
She can only fool herself for so long x3
Im too weak to face me
she can only fool herself

chorus
I never know just why you run so far away far away from me x2

When it comes to how to live his life he cant be told
Says hes got it all under control
Thinks he knows its not a problem hes stuck with
But in reality itd be a problem to just quit
An addict and he cant hold the reins
The pain is worse cause his friends have it the same
Tries to slow down the problem hes got
But cant get off the carousel until he makes it stop
He can only fool himself for so long x3
Im too weak to face me
he can only fool himself

chorus x2

Fly with me under the wings I gave you
Try to be closer to me and Ill save you x2

chorus x4

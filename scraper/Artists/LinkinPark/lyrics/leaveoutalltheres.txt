Leave Out All The Rest

I dreamed I was missing
You were so scared
But no one would listen
Cause no one else cared

After my dreaming
I woke with this fear
What am I leaving
When Im done here

So if youre asking me
I want you to know

Chorus
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that Ive done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
And dont resent me
And when youre feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Dont be afraid
Ive taken my beating
Ive shared what Ive made
Im strong on the surface
Not all the way through
Ive never been perfect
But neither have you

So if youre asking me
I want you to know

Chorus
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that Ive done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
Dont resent me
And when youre feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Forgetting all the hurt inside
Youve learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else can come
And save me from myself
I cant be who you are

Chorus
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that Ive done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
Dont resent me
And when youre feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Forgetting all the hurt inside
Youve learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else can come
And save me from myself
I cant be who you are
I cant be who you are

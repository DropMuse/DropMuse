Uh yeah

Why does it feel like night today
Something in heres not right today
Why am I so uptight today
Paranoias all I got left
I dont know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Its like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches everytime I lie
A face that laughs everytime I fall
And watches everything
So know that when its time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

Its like Im paranoid looking over my back
Its like a whirlwind inside of my head
Its like I cant stop what Im hearing within
Its like a face inside thats right beneath my skin

Hey yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel isnt real
But in my mind I find myself in places with names but not faces
My memory races at speeds
Hundred degrees
My soul bleeds devil mustve planted the seed
Now it feels like my backs against the wall
Im taking the fall
Whenever I call nobodys responding at all
But I dont know who I can trust
The screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the frame
All Im trying to do is just master me
All I want to do is smoke a blasttobeat
But something keeps talking to me
Consciously responsibly keeps haunting me from dusk til dawn
Everything has something for you
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia
Cold sweat shining on your face
Exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off your skin Id probably find another person
Theres nothing worse than trying to bring yourself on back from the dead
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head 

Its like Im paranoid looking over my back
Its like a whirlwind inside of my head
Its like I cant stop what Im hearing within
Its like a face inside thats right beneath my skin

Its like Im paranoid looking over my back
Its like a whirlwind inside of my head
Its like I cant stop what Im hearing within
Its like a face inside thats right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
Its like Im paranoid
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
Cant stop what Im hearing within
Its like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Its like Im paranoid looking over my back
Its like a whirlwind inside of my head
Its like I cant stop what Im hearing within
Its like a face inside thats right beneath my skin

Its like Im paranoid looking over my back
Its like a whirlwind inside of my head
Its like I cant stop what Im hearing within
Its like a face inside thats right beneath my skin

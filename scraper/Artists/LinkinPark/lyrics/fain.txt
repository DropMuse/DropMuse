Faint

I am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I cant help the fact that everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want what I want you to feel
But its like no matter what I do I cant convince you to just believe this is real
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that Im not
But Ill be here cause youre all that I got

Chorus
I cant feel the way I did before
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored
Time wont heal this damage anymore
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored

I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
Cause you dont understand I do what I can but sometimes I dont make sense
I am what you never wanna say but Ive never had a doubt
Its like no matter what I do I cant convince you for once just to hear me out
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that Im not
But Ill be here cause youre all that Ive got

Chorus
I cant feel the way I did before
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored
Time wont heal this damage anymore
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored

Now
Hear me out now
Youre gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now
Hear me out now
Youre gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now

I cant feel the way I did before
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored

Chorus
I cant feel the way I did before
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored
Time wont heal this damage anymore
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored

I cant feel
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored
Time wont heal
Dont turn your back on me
I wont be ignored

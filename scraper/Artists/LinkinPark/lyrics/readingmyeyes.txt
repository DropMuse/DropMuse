Reading My Eyes

The microphone molester machete undresser
Stupiddopefresh type shit resurrector
Top gun Miramar bestofthebester
The leaveanMCpeaceinrester
Skill tester the flexthegunner
The makefunner the adversary make runner
Make summer cold with rhymes I spit
Kick gift to lifted delinquent wit
I be the prophet my rhymetop it Stop it
Fly like rocket when I rock it
Lock it down with this perverse verse
Every fuckin curse a burst of hurt
Move crowds physical fitness rhymes
Coke heads couldnt do my lines
Im decorated like christmas pines
My battalion rocks
MCs become silohetes of chalk

Reading my eyes will say it in many ways
Losing my pride will save it in many days

Hit the dirt because the words I spit will
Do more than just rip your shirt
Ill bitch slap your soul contact the track control
Youre coming at me You cant hack it though
So ridiculous watching my crew get sick of this
Wickedness pitchin this lyrical viciousness
To crews and cliques made of men and mistresses
This is my life the twilight and the fight night
And trying to see nothing but the highlights when I write
These eyes on horizons die for my song cry rhymes in Krylon
Fire on move men telekinetically
Esoterically beatspeaking with clarity
Feel my verity heroism of heresy
And sever every MC I see with severity

Reading my eyes will say it in many ways
Losing my pride will save it in many days

Why not what I came Why not what I came

Why not give me what I came to deserve
Why not give me what I came to believe
Why not give me what I came to deserve
Why not give me what I came to believe

Reading my eyes will say it in many ways
Losing my pride will save it in many days

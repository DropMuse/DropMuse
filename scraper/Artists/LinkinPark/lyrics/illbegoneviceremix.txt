I'll Be Gone (Vice Remix)

Like shining oil this night is dripping down
Stars are slipping down glistening
And Im trying not to think what Im leaving now
No deceiving now its time you let me go
Let me go

Ill be gone
Ill be gone

Pusha T
King Push
Dope game keep callin
Dope boys keep fallin
Askin me Whats my legacy
I just wanna die ballin
I just wanna die pourin
I just wanna ride foreign
I just wanna bring hoes together
Lonny Lisa meet Lauren Wooo
Then I be gone keep it movin what I be on
Damn right I know what time it is
Patek Philippe and the Tourbillion Yuugh
Im stylin on em Im swervin on em
I know its wrong but lifes a bitch and she turn me on

Yeah and to each his own
Hatin aint something that we condone
Is the way I flip when the beat come on
I gonna pop that shit til your speakers blown
And yall wanna cop a plea
Who you gon talk to Not to me

Because the chain of command work properly
You gotta earn a few stripes til you talk to me
Word to Pusha word to Vice
Built a track once and killed it twice
Built a stage up and killed the lights
Opening act was like Fuck my life
Yall can love it aint nothing wrong
Forget the hatin that yall be on
Enjoy it now because after long
Keyser SÃ¶ze Ill be gone

Ill be gone
Ill be gone

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence Ill be gone
Ill be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow Ill be gone
Ill be gone

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence Ill be gone
Ill be gone

Ill be gone
Ill be gone
Ill be gone

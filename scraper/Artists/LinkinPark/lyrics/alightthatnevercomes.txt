A Light That Never Comes

Nah you dont know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me cannot hold me
You cannot stop much less control me
When it rains it pours
When the floodgates open brace your shores
That pressure dont care when it breaks your doors
Say its all you can take better take some more

Oh
Cause I know what its like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate

Oh
Night gets darkest right before dawn
What dont kill you makes you more strong
And I been waiting for it so long

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh Oh Oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

When I was young they told me they said
Make your bed you lie in that bed
A king can only reign til instead
There comes that day its off with his head

Oh
Night gets darkest right before dawn
What dont kill you makes you more strong
Youll have my mercy then when youre gone

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh Oh Oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

And I told them
Nah you dont know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me cannot hold me
You cannot stop much less control me
When it rains it pours
When the floodgates open brace your shores
That pressure dont care it breaks your doors
Say its all you can take better take some more

Oh Oh Oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh Oh Oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

LinkinPark
When They Come For Me

I am not a pattern to be followed
The pill that Im on is a tough one to swallow
Im not a criminal not a role model
Not a born leader Im a tough act to follow
I am not the fortune and the fame or the same person telling you to forfeit the game
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain and then found out the underbellys sicker than it seems
And it seems ugly but it can get worse
cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
And Im not a robot Im not a monkey
I will not dance even if the beats funky
Opposite of lazy far from a punk

Yall oughta stop talking
Start trying to catch up mother fucker
And all the people say
Try to catch up mother fucker

Lauryn said money change the situation
Big said it increase the complication
Kane said dont step I aint the one
Chuck said an Uzi weighs a mother fucking ton
And Im just a student of the game that they taught me
Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me
Im awfully underrated but came here to correct it
And so it aint mistaken Imma say it for the record
I am the opposite of wack opposite of weak
Opposite of slack synonym of heat synonym of crack
Closest to a peak far from a punk
Yall oughta stop talking start trying to catch up mother fucker

And all the people say
Try to catch up mother fucker

When they come for me
Come for me
Ill be gone x3

And all the people say
Try to catch up mother fucker

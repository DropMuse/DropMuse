A Light That Never Comes (Rick Rubin Remix)

Nah you dont know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me cannot hold me
You cannot stop much less control me

When it rains it pours
When the floodgates open brace your shores
That pressure dont care when it breaks your door
Say its all you can take better take some more

When I was young they told me they said
Make your bed you lie in that bed
A king cant hold my rings so instead
It comes that day its off with his head

The night gets darkest right before dawn
What dont kill you makes you more strong
Youll have my mercy then when youre gone

Cause I know what its like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate

The night gets darkest right before dawn
What dont kill you makes you more strong
Youll have my mercy then when youre gone

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh oh oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

Nah you dont know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me cannot hold me
You cannot stop much less control me

When it rains it pours
When the floodgates open brace your shores
That pressure dont care when it breaks your door
Say its all you can take better take some more

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh oh oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes Take some more
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

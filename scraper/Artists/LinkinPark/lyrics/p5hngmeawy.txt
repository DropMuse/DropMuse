P5hng Me A*wy

When I look into your eyes theres nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me

Backwards
Everything has to end
Youll soon find that were out of time left to watch it all unwind
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end
Youll soon find that were out of time left to watch in all unwind
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down

Ive lied to you
This is the last smile that Ill fake for the sake of being with you
Everything falls apart even
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end
Youll soon find were out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sake of being with you
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
Youre still so blind to me

Backwards
Even the people who never frown eventually break down

Ive tried like you to do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
That Ill take the blame for the sake of being with you
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
Youll soon find were out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
Youre still so blind to me

Reverse psychology is failing miserably
Its so hard to be left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
There is nothing left but to turn and face you
When I look into your eyes there nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me
Asking why
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
Youre still so blind to me

Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
Youre still so blind to me

If your having girl problems I feel bad for you son

Hit me

Got Mike
Hes got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure his caskets closed
Rap critics that say hes Money Cash Hoes
Hes from the hood stupid what type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapitos
Youd celebrate the minute you was having doe
So fuck critics you can kiss our whole asshole
If you dont like my lyrics you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if we dont play they show
They dont play out hits well we dont give a shit SO
All these mags try and use our ass
So advertisers can give em more cash for ads fuckers
I dont know what you take us as
or understand the intelligence that JayZ has
Im from rags to ritches nigga we aint dumb
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one
Hit me

99 Problems but a bitch aint one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one

The year is 94 and in my trunk is raw
In my rear view mirror is the motherfucking law
I got two choices youll pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor
Now I aint trying to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
And I heard Son do you know why Im stopping you for
Cause Im young and Im black and my hats real low
Do I look like a mind reader sir I dont know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more
Well you was doing fifty five in a fifty four
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you  I know a lot of you are
I aint stepping out of shit all my papers legit
Do you mind if I look round the car a little bit
Well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk and the back
And I know my rights so you gon need a warrant for that
Arent you sharp as a tack are some type of lawyer or something
Or somebody important or something
Nah I aint pass the bar but I know a little bit
Enough that you wont illegally search my shit
Well see how smart you are when the K9s come
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one
Hit me

Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe
This is not a hoe in the sense of having a pussy
But a pussy having no god damn sense try and push me
I tried to ignore him and talk to the Lord
Pray for him cause some fools just love to perform
You know the type loud as a motor bike
But wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
The only thing thats gonna happen is Imma get to clapping
He and his boys gon be yapping to the captain
And there I go trapped in the kit kat again
Back through the system with the riff raff again
Fiends on the floor scratching again
Paparazzis with theie cameras snapping them
DA tried to give the nigga the shaft again
Halfamil for bail cause Im African
All because this fool was harassing them
Trying to play the boy like hes scaring
But aint nothing sweet bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems but this bitch aint one

99 Problems but a bitch aint one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one
Hit me
99 Problems but a bitch aint one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one
Hit me

Shut up when Im talking to you
Shut up shut up shut up
Shut up when Im talking to you
Shut up shut up shut up

Im about to BREAK

Everything you say to me
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one
Hit me
I need a little room to breathe
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one
Hit me
Everything you say to me
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one
Hit me
I need a little room to breathe
I got 99 problems
And Im about to

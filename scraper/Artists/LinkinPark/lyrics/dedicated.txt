LinkinPark
Dedicated

I have a dream of a scene between the green hills
Clouds pull away and the sunlights revealed
People dont talk about keeping it real
Its understood that they actually will
And intoxicated and stimulated emcees
Staring in the trees paranoid are gone in the breeze
Watch them flee hiphop hits
Take a walk with me and what youll see
Is a land where the sand is made up of crushed up wax
And the sky beyond you is krylon blue
And everybody speaks in a dialect of rhyme
And emcees have left materialism behind them
Meanwhile I just grip my mic
And hope me and my team make it do alright
Because say what you will and say what you might
But dont ignore who its for at the end of the night

CHORUS
Because this is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to wherever music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol same
And dedicated to the people advancin the game
Whats real is the kids who know that somethings wrong
Whats real is the kids who think they dont belong
Whats real is the kids who have nowhere to run
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun

Ive seen a lot of shit Ive talked to a bum
Out on sunset strip he asked me How would you feel
If everybody acted like you didnt exist
Youd lose your grip probably eventually flip
So let it be known the only reason that we do this
Is so you can pick it up and just bang your head to it
While emcees fight to see who can be the commonest
Be floatin overhead like a space odyssey monolith
Over seeing the game over being part of the same ol thing
Its all gonna change in a hurricane of darkness and pain
And acidic rain and promises that you wont do it again
Meanwhile I just grip my mic
And hope me and my team make it do alright
Because say what you will and say what you might
But dont ignore who its for at the end of the night

Chorus

Pulling me close the shadow is warm inside
This is where I feel at home this is my place to hide
Pulling me close the shadow is warm inside
This is where I feel at home this is my place to hide

Chorus

This is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to wherever music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol same
And dedicated to the people advancin the game
Whats real everybody who doesnt feel safe
Whats real everybody who knows theyre out of place
Whats real anybody with nowhere to run
Who hides in the shadows waiting for the sun

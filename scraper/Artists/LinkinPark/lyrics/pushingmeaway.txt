Pushing Me Away

Ive lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That Ill fake for the sake of being with you

Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown
Eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
Youll soon find were out of time left
To watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see youre testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away

Ive tried like you
To do everything you wanted too
This is the last time
Ill take the blame for the sake of being with you

Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown
Eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
Youll soon find were out of time left
To watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see youre testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see youre testing me pushes me away
Were all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Were all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see youre testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see youre testing me pushes me away
Pushes me away

Esaul (A Place For My Head Demo)

Verse 1
Ridin with a head full of buckets of red
And when I said is still stuck in my head
Im full of red thoroughly bled
And led to the land of the middle combats
Comin another front tack can never run from that
From planets to a size as Im milkin the horizon
Smaller than the flies and of a lyrical land
Of the power that Ive got in my cynical hand
With the pen once again swimmin
In the centre of the hit or the miss
Readin all my thoughts gettin lost in the mist
Realise the one that the size of the fist
And the killin of the killer with a flick of the wrist

Chorus
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I
Live for them
Still I see that its not meant to be for me
I wanna be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

Verse 2
And the second is gone
The weapon of time is stronger than a nuclear bomb
And turn into your halflife
Somethin that math cant write
You cant fight nor flee
Still be around if it wasnt for me
Way back would split up with my friends
So you can see the attraction of the payback
Dont want me to say that
Play back the thing now gettin lost in the chaos
Tossin it down
Singin again to myself
Electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head fulla hectics
At this you can tell a TV on time
An addict to the panic of my confine
Singin the thing to myself
Electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head fulla hectics
At this you can tell a TV on time
An addict to the panic of my confine

Chorus
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I
Live for them
Still I see that its not meant to be for me
I wanna be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

Heal my wounds soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds soon
Yesterday will heat my room
Heal my wounds

Chorus
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I
Live for them
Still I see that its not meant to be for me
I wanna be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

Burn
Burn
Burn
Burn

Singin the thing to myself
Electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head fulla hectics
At this you can tell a TV on time
An addict to the panic of my confine
Singin the thing to myself
Electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head fulla hectics
At this you can tell a TV on time
An addict to the panic of my confine

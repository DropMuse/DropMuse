LinkinPark
Bleed It Out

Yeah here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line

Throw em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind

Filthy mouth no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose

String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I wont get loose

Truth is you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares

Dug the trench out laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere

Yeah someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again

Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

Chorus
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out

Go stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow

Shotgun opera lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go

Mama help me Ive been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse

Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Cant contain him he knows he works

Fuck this hurts I wont lie
Doesnt matter how hard I try

Half the words dont mean a thing
And I know that I wont be satisfied

So why try ignoring him
Make it a dirt dance floor again

Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

Chorus
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out

Ive opened up these scars
Ill make you face this

Ive pulled myself so far
Ill make you face this now

Chorus
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it out

Never again victimized

Theyre acting like they want a riot its a riot Ill give em
As the siren climbs higher on this violent rhythm
For you snakes in the grass supplying the venom
I aint scared of your teeth I admire whats in em
You been waiting in the shadows there thinking youre hidden
But the truth is you dont have the stomach to get em
Go on already hit em yeah you gotta be kidding
Wanna talk about a victim Imma put you there with em

Victimized

Never again victimized

Never again victimized

Theyre acting like they want a riot its a riot Ill give em
Theyre acting like they want a riot its a riot Ill give em
Theyre acting like they want a riot its a riot Ill give em
Theyre acting like they want a riot its a riot riot riot riot riot

No
No
No No regret for the confidence betrayed
No more hiding in shadow
Cause I wont wait for the debt to be repaid
Time has come for you

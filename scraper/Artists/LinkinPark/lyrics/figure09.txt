Figure.09

Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happening
Its like nothing I can do would distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
Cause from the infinite words I could say I
Put all pain you gave to me on display
But didnt realize instead of setting it free I
Took what I hated and made it a part of me

Never goes away
Never goes away

Chorus
And now
Youve become a part of me
Youll always be right here
Youve become a part of me
Youll always be my fear
I cant separate
Myself from what Ive done
Giving up a part of me
Ive let myself become you

Hearing your name the memories come back again
I remember when it started happening
I see you in every thought I had and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committing myself to them and everyday
I regret saying those things cuz now I see that I
Took what I hated and made it a part of me

Never goes away
Never goes away

Chorus
And now
Youve become a part of me
Youll always be right here
Youve become a part of me
Youll always be my fear
I cant separate
Myself from what Ive done
Giving up a part of me
Ive let myself become you

Never goes away
Never goes away
Never goes away
Never goes away

Get away from me
Give me my space back you gotta just
Go
Everything comes down the memories of
You
Ive kept it in but now Im letting you
Know
I let you go so get away from
Me
Give me my space back you gotta just
Go
Everything comes down the memories of
You
Ive kept it but now Im letting you
Know
I let you go

And now
Youve become a part of me
Youll always be right here
Youve become a part of me
Youll always be my fear
I cant separate
Myself from what Ive done
Giving up a part of me
Ive let myself become you

Ive let myself become you
Ive let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me Ive let myself become you

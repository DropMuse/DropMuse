In Pieces

Telling me to go
But hands beg me to stay

Your lips say that you love
Your eyes say that you hate

Theres truth in your lies
Doubt in your faith
What you build you lay to waste

Theres truth in your lies
Doubt in your faith
All Ive gots what you didnt take

So I I wont be the one
Be the one to leave this
In pieces

And you
You will be alone
Alone with all your secrets
And regrets

Dont lie

You promised me the sky
Then tossed me like a stone

You wrap me in your arms
And chill me to the bone

Theres truth in your lies
Doubt in your faith
All Ive gots what you didnt take

So I I wont be the one
Be the one to leave this
In pieces

And you
You will be alone
Alone with all your secrets
And regrets

Dont lie

So I I wont be the one
Be the one to leave this
In pieces

And you
You will be alone
Alone with all your secrets
And regrets

Dont lie

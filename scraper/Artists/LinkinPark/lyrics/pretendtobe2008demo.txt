Pretend To Be (2008 Demo)

You say that youre proud of me
Ooo oo oo oo
And take somethin out of me
So oo oow
Predictable
Why do I have to see this through
why do I have to take this
isnt there something I can do
to make myself finally say this

Chorus
No
Youve taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
Youre not the one that you pretend to be 

Youre stuck with apologies
Ooo oo oo oo
And take another shot of me
So oo oow
Predictable
Why do I have to see this through
why do I have to take this
isnt there something I can do
to make myself finally say this

Chorus
No
Youve taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
Youre not the one that you pretend to be 

No
Youve taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
Youre not the one that you pretend to be 

Oo Oo

No
Youve taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
Youre not the one that you pretend to be 

No
Youve taken this too far
Exposing who you are
For all to see
Youre not the one that you pretend to be

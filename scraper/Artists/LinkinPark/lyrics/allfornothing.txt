All For Nothing

Yeah
Uh
So whatcha waiting for
Anticipating more
Why you debate what it can take to instigate a war
Yeah Ive been hating on the time I wasnt hated for
Theres nothing they can fucking say they didnt say before
But you could never see it your battles not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe but this is take a shot time
Youre waiting for a purpose I already got mine
While you tell me step to it like 1 2 3 4

And if I do what you demand
You say
Youll let me understand
You say
Youre gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
You say
Ill have no debt to pay
You say
Im gonna get what I deserve
Woah

Your word
Obeyed
My debt
Repaid
Our trust
Betrayed
All for nothing
All for nothing

Came back theres no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for ya
I really dont know ya
Youre talk but let me show you where to put your paranoia
Yourre joking I dont have a half a sucker bone to throw yah
Im disgusted wonder whats gonna make you tuck your tail below ya
And no Im not your soldier Im not taking any orders
Im a five star general infantry controller need a lesson let me show you
Have you checking your composure while I make you step to it like 1 2 3 4

And if I do what you demand
You say
Youll let me understand
You say
Youre gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
You say
Ill have no debt to pay
You say
Im gonna get what I deserve
Woah

And if I do what you demand
Youll let me understand

Your word
Obeyed
My debt
Repaid
Our trust
Betrayed
All for nothing
All for nothing

All for nothing
All for

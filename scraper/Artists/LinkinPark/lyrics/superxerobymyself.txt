Super Xero (By Myself)

What do I do to ignore whats behind me
Do I follow my fate and escape blindly
Do I hide my pride away from these bad dreams
And give into sad thoughts that are maddening
Do I let it go and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them redhanded
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust nobody and live life in lonliness

The sunlight burns the skin of sleeping men
I make the right turns but Im lost within
I put on my daily fa√ßade but then
I just end up gettin hurt again

prechorus
By myself Myself
I ask why but in my mind I find
I cant rely on myself Myself
I ask why but in my mind I find
I cant rely on myself

chorus
I cant hold on
To what I want when Im stretched so thin
Its all too much to take in
I cant hold on
To anything watchin everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back Im defenseless
And to give in to fate seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on 
Then theyll take from me til everything is gone
If I let them go Ill be outdone
But if I try to catch them Ill be outrun
If Im killed by the questions like a cancer
Then Ill be buried in the silence of the answer

prechorus and chorus

How do you think
That Ive lost so much
Im always afraid
That Im out of touch
How do you expect
That I will know what to do
When all I know
Is what you tell me to

Dont you know
I cant tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do how hard I try
I cant seem to convince myself why
Im stuck on the outside
x2

chorus

I cant hold on
To what I want when Im stretched so thin
Its all too much to take in
I cant hold on
To anything watchin everything spin
With thoughts of failure from within

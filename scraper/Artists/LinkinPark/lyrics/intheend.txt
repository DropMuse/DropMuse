In The End

It starts with
One thing I dont know why
It doesnt even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
Its so unreal
Didnt look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on but didnt even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside and even though I tried it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesnt even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesnt even matter

One thing I dont know why
It doesnt even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Im surprised it got so far
Things arent the way they were before
You wouldnt even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
In the end

You kept everything inside and even though I tried it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesnt even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesnt even matter

Ive put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
Theres only one thing you should know
Ive put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
Theres only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesnt even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesnt even matter

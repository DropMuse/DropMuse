LinkinPark
Crawling

Chorus
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Theres something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming confusing
This lack of selfcontrol I fear is never ending
Controlling I cant seem

Bridge
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
without a sense of confidence and Im convinced that theres just too much pressure to take
Ive felt this way before
So insecure

Chorus

Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
Its haunting how I cant seem

Bridge

Chorus

Chorus

Theres something inside me that pulls beneath the surface consuming
Confusing what is real
This lack of selfcontrol I fear is never ending controlling
Confusing what is real

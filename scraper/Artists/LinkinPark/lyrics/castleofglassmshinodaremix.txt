Castle Of Glass (M. Shinoda Remix)

Take me down to the river bend Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again Show me how to be whole again

Fly me up on a silver wing Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in the novas glow Warm me up in the novas glow
And drop me down to the dream below And drop me down to the dream below

Cause Im only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again gain gain gain

Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm Warm me up in the novas glow
And drop me down to the dream below low low low

Cause Im only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see

For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see

Cause Im only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
Cause Im only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see

For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see

Cause Im only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
Cause Im only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see

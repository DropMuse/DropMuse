Numb / Encore

Thank you thank you thank you youre far too kind

Now can I get an encore do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need yall to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me there shall be no more
So for one last time nigga make some noise

Get em Jay

Who you know fresher than Hov Riddle me that
The rest of yall know where Im lyrically at
Cant none of yall mirror me back
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G Rap in his prime
Im young HO raps Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe now break bread
Im in Boeing jets Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young what the fuck you expect Yep yep
Grand openin grand closin
God damn your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you gon find doper than him with no pen
just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon see you cant replace him
with cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS

Now can I get an encore do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need yall to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me there shall be no more
So for one last time nigga make some noise

What the hell are you waiting for

sighs Look what you made me do look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues how will they pay you
When you first come in the game they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years yea
As fate would have it Jays status appears
to be at an alltime high perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan wearin the 45
It aint to play games witchu
Its to aim at you probably maim you
If I owe you Im blowin you to smithereeens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing one thing
I came I saw I conquered
From record sales to sold out concerts
So muhfucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream til your lungs get sore

Im tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Dont know what youre expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

Ive become so numb I cant feel you there
Ive become so tired so much more aware
Im becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Ive become so numb
Can I get an encore do you want more more
Ive become so numb
So for one last time I need yall to roar
One last time I need yall to roar

LinkinPark
Across The Line (Unreleased 2007 Demo)

In this desert
In darkness
Lying with the gun across his chest
Pretending
Hes heartless
As the fire flashes in the sky
He was fragile
And frozen
When the bullet took away his friend
And now hes somehow
More broken

Hes pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line
Hes pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

Sweating
And shaking
Lying with her hands across her chest
She wakes with
Her cravings
As the fire flashes in her eye
She was fragile
And frozen
When the needle took away her friend
But now shes somehow
More broken

Shes pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line
Shes pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

With every battle hes choosing
With every fight hes losing
His enemys not far behind
With every promise shes broken
With every lie shes spoken
Her enemys not far behind

Its your time
Its your time
Its your time
Its  your  TIME

Hes pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line
Shes pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

With every battle hes choosing
With every fight hes losing
His enemys not far behind
With every promise shes broken
With every lie shes spoken
Her enemys not far behind

LinkinPark
With You

I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering Im pretending to be where Im not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy

And Im left in the wake of the mistake slow to react
So even though youre so close to me
Youre still so distant and I cant bring you back

Bridge
Its true the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if youre not with me

Chorus
Im with you
You
Now I see keeping everything inside
with you
You
Now I see
Even when I close my eyes
with you
You
Now I see keeping everything inside
with you
You
Now I see even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong I pretend the past isnt real
Now Im trapped in this memory

And Im left in the wake of the mistake slow to react
So even though youre close to me
Youre still so distant and I cant bring you back

Bridge

Chorus

No no matter how far weve come
I cant wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far weve come I
I cant wait to see tomorrow

Chorus
with you
You
Now I see keeping everything inside
with you
You
Now I see even when I close my eyes
with you
You
Now I see keeping everything inside
with you
You
Now I see even when I close my eyes

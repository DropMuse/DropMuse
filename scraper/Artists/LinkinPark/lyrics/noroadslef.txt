LinkinPark
No Roads Left

Standing alone with no direction
How did I fall so far behind
Why am I searching for perfection
Knowing its something I wont find

In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because

Chorus
I run
Till the silence splits me open
I run
Till it puts me underground
Till I have no breath
And no roads left but one

When did I lose my sense of purpose
Can I regain whats lost inside
Why do I feel like I deserve this
Why does my pain look like my pride

In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because
I let myself down
In my fear and flaws

Chorus
I run
Till the silence splits me open
I run
Till it puts me underground
Till I have no breath
And no roads left but one
No roads left but one

In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because

I run
And the silence splits me open
I run
And it puts me underground
But theres no regret
And no roads left to run

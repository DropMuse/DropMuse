What I've Done (Mike Shinoda Remix)

In this farewell
Theres no blood
Theres no alibi
Cause Ive drawn regret
From the truth
Of a thousand lies

So let mercy come
And wash away

What Ive done
Ill face myself
To cross out what Ive become
Erase myself
And let go of what Ive done

Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands
Of uncertainty

So let mercy come
And wash away

What Ive done
Ill face myself
To cross out what Ive become
Erase myself
And let go of what Ive done

Done Ill start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
Im forgiving what Ive 

Done
Ill face myself
To cross out what Ive become
Erase myself
And let go of what Ive done
What Ive done

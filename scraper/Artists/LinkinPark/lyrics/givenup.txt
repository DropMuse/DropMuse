LinkinPark
Given Up

Wake in a sweat again
Another days been laid to waste
In my disgrace

Stuck in my head again
Feels like Ill never leave this place
Theres no escape

Im my own worst enemy

chorus
Ive given up
Im sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say

Take this all away
Im suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong
With me
end chorus

I dont know what to take
Thought I was focused but Im scared
Im not prepared

I hyperventilate
Looking for help somehow somewhere
And no one cares

Im my own worst enemy

chorus
Ive given up
Im sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say

Take this all away
Im suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong
With me
end chorus

bridge
Goddddddd

Put me out of my misery
Put me out of my misery
Put me out of my
Put me out of my fucking misery
end bridge

chorus
Ive given up
Im sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say

Take this all away
Im suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong
With me
end chorus

LinkinPark
Powerless

You hid your skeletons when I had shown you mine
You woke the devil that I thought youd left behind
I saw the evidence the crimson soaking through
Ten thousand promises ten thousand ways to lose

Chorus
And you held it all but you were careless to let it fall
You held it all and I was by your side powerless

I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end
Im left with emptiness that words cannot defend
Youll never know what I became because of you
Ten thousand promises ten thousand ways to lose

Chorus x2
And you held it all but you were careless to let it fall
You held it all and I was by your side powerless

Powerless x2

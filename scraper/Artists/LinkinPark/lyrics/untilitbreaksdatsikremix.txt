Until It Breaks (Datsik Remix)

Original style like an 808 drum
Original style like an 808 drum
I dont run the track no I make the track run
I dont run the track no I make the track run

Original style like an 808 drum
Original style like an 808 drum
I dont run the track no I make the track run
I dont run the track no I make the track run

Like that

Drop it like

Make the track run
Like that
Make the track run
Like that
It goes a one two three

Playing with the big guns only get you slain
Playing with the big guns only get you slain
PPPlaying with the big guns only get you slain
Playing with the big guns big guns big guns

Playing with the big guns only get you slain
Playing with the big guns only get you slain
PPPlaying with the big guns only get you slain
Playing with the big guns only get you slain
Like that

Like that
I dont run the track no I make the track run
Like that

Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring
The poor men sing
Bring me to kingdom come

Drop it like that
Like that
Like that
Drop it like that
Like that

Make the track run

Make the track run
Like that

It goes a one two three

Playing with the big guns only get you slain
Playing with the big guns only get you slain
PPPlaying with the big guns only get you slain
Playing with the big guns big guns big guns

Playing with the big guns only get you slain
Playing with the big guns only get you slain
PPPlaying with the big guns only get you slain
Playing with the big guns only get you slain

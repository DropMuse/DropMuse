A Place For My Head

I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
And the sun doesnt give light to the moon assuming
The moons gonna owe it one
It makes me think of how you act for me
You do favors and then rapidly
You just turn around and start asking me
About things that you want back from me

Chorus
Im sick of the tension sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you dont understand
Youll see its not meant to be
I want to be in the energy not with the enemy
A place for my head

Maybe someday Ill be just like you
And step on people like you do and
Run away of the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm used to be strong
Used to be generous but you shouldve known
That youd wear out your welcome
And now you see how quiet it is all alone

Chorus 2x
Im so sick of the tension sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you dont understand
Youll see its not meant to be
I want to be in the energy not with the enemy
A place for my head

8x
You try to take the best of me
Go away

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you dont understand
Youll see its not meant to be
I want to be in the energy not with the enemy
A place for my head

Stay away

Im so sick of the tension stay
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed a
While I find a place to rest

Im so sick of the tension way
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed stay away from me
While I find a place to rest

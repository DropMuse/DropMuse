LinkinPark

Hey yo
When this first started off
It was just Linkin Park
And then in the middle
Came Motion Man
And at the end of it all
It was Kutmasta Kurt
With a remix

One thing I dont know why
It doesnt even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time
All I know time was just slipping away
And I watched it count down to the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didnt look out below
And I watched the time go right out the window
Tried to grab hold
Tried not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesnt even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesnt even matter

Hey yo
One thing I dont know why
It doesnt even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know hah I sosocialse
Like the host of the party
I spoke shaked and made eyecontact
Partied and toasted strong all that
Northeast Southwest coast
Im staring out the window
No oppourtunity to mingle
I tried to sew it up to weaken your system
I had you throwing up
I brought you back into things
Like the imaginary man of your dreams
Youd always seem to make it worth it
I pigskin I never nerf it
You felt like loving never played real
Im bringing the pleasure
By any means it means Im leaving your team
Hell of a team man it seems I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesnt even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesnt even matter

One thing I dont know how
It doesnt even matter when you look at it now
Cause when I designed this rhyme
I was scared of it all scared to fall and I hadnt even tried to crawl
But I was forced to run with you mocking me stopping me backstabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Watch the clock now chockfull of hipocrisy
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said to make things fail
Every single word you sputtered just to get your piece
But it really doesnt matter to me
Cause from the start to the end no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesnt even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesnt even matter

In the end

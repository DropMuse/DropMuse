LinkinPark
High Voltage (Remix)

You know what I mean
You could put a label on a life
Put a label on a lifestyle

Sometimes

You know
Put a label on how you wake up every morning 
And go to bed at night

Hybrid 

Ive been diggin into crates ever since I was livin in space
Before the ratrace before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and bigbang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic so I could start blessin it
Chincheckin kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us 
But I twist mic cords in double helixes and show them what Im made of
I buckle knees like leg braces 
Cast the spell of instrumentalness and all of you emcees who hate us
So you can try on
Leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity let icons be bygones
I fire bomb ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

High Voltage
The unforgettable sound
High Voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High Voltage
Coming at you from every side
High Voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Akira I put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Sprayin bright day over what you might say
My Blood types Krylon Technicolor type A
On highways ride with road rage 
Cages of wind and cages of tin that bounce all around
Surround sound
Devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings
Over while the same thing
Sing song karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stone tactics
Fourth dimension combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention 
Meant to put you away with the pencil
Pistol official 16 line a rhyme missile
While you risk your all I pick out all your flaws
Spin rah blah blah blah 
You can say you saw

High Voltage
The Unforgettable sound
High Voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High Voltage
Coming at you from every side
High Voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High Voltage
The Unforgettable sound
High Voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High Voltage
Coming at you from every side
High Voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

And like the rock and rap
You know what i mean 
People act like you know
Wow thats a new invention
That shits brand new
Were constantly evolving
It is constantly changing 

Sometimes 

Theres a lot of change 
Everybodys always up with labels
There aint no label for this shit
Theyre always gonna try to put a label on it
Try to create something 
So they can water it down 

Sometimes I feel like a prophet 
Misunderstood 
Under the gun like a new disease

Sometimes I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood 
Under the gun like a new disease

High Voltage
The Unforgettable sound
High Voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High Voltage
Coming at you from every side
High Voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High Voltage
The Unforgettable sound
High Voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High Voltage
Coming at you from every side
High Voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High Voltage
The Unforgettable sound
High Voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High Voltage
Coming at you from every side
High Voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High Voltage
The Unforgettable sound
High Voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High Voltage
Coming at you from every side
High Voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

You know what I mean you can put a label on a lifestyle

I'll Be Gone

Like shining oil this night is dripping down
Stars are slipping down glistening
And Im trying not to think what Im leaving now
No deceiving now its time you let me know
Let me know

Chorus
When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence Ill be gone Ill be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow Ill be gone Ill be gone

This air between us is getting thinner now
Into winter now Bitter sweet
And cross that horizon this sun is setting down
Youre forgetting now its time you let me go let me go

Chorus
When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence Ill be gone Ill be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow Ill be gone Ill be gone

Bridge
And tell them I couldnt tell myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh tell me I am the only one
And theres nothing that can stop me

Chorus
When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence Ill be gone Ill be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow Ill be gone Ill be gone Ill be gone

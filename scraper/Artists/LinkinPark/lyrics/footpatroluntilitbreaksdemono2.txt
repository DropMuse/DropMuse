LinkinPark
Foot Patrol (Until It Breaks Demo, No. 2)

You dont give a damn about the blood and sweat that I spill
To make your soul standing right here
But you can bet your soul and your faith in God that I will
Not fold in the face of this rear
Cause I wont be intimidated by you push down to lie to
Im not before Im pumped
And you can try to proves me and break but please dont mistake
And see if I dont give a backup
Now now see if I dont give a backup
Now now see if I dont give a backup
Now now see if I dont give a backup
Now now see if I dont give a backup

Its something for your people on the block to
Black out and rock to
Give you what you need like papa who shot ya
Separate the weak from the obsolete
Youre meek I creep hard on imposters
And switch styles on the dime quickwitted
Yall quit trippin I dont have time for your crying
I grind tough sucker make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the lineup
Bang bang little monkey man
Playing with the big guns only get you stain I aint playing
Im just saying you aint got a sliver of a chance
I get iller I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake shake down money heres the breakdown
You can play the bank Imma play the bank takedown
And no mistakes now coming to get ya
Im just a Banksy youre a Brainwash
Get the picture
Its like that

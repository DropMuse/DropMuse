She Couldn't

Wont be long till everybody knows

Ive seen her smiling
The sunlight shining for her now
She couldnt stay here
She knows you wont let her down

You know she couldnt stay here with you
You know she had to go
Even though she couldnt stay here with you
You know youre not alone

2x
No matter what you think you did wrong
Wont be long till everybody knows
She knew she had to go all along
Wont be long till everybody knows

Ive seen her shining
The sunlights crying for her now
She wouldnt stay here
She knows you wont let her down

You know she couldnt stay here with you
You know she had to go
Even though she couldnt stay here with you
You know youre not alone

2x
No matter what you think you did wrong
Wont be long till everybody knows
She knew she had to go all along
Wont be long till everybody knows

Wont be long till everybody knows
Wont be long till everybody knows
Wont be long till everybody knows

2x
No matter what you think you did wrong
Wont be long till everybody knows
She knew she had to go all along
Wont be long till everybody knows

Repeat until faded out
No matter what you think you did wrong
You know she couldnt stay here with you
She knew she had to go all along
You know she had to go

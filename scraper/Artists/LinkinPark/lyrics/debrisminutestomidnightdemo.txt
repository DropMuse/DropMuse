Debris (Minutes To Midnight Demo)

Listen
My blood feels like its sitting still in my veins
My motivation was gone before it even came
Today and yesterday they both seem the same
And no matter how I try I just cant change
Give me one reason I should go outside
Everything Ill be the same no matter what I try
Some peoplell live and some peoplell die
Some peoplell build their whole life on a lie
I used to blame you for the things that I thought youd say
So now I cant blame you for going away
Cause these memories are the blood beating under my skin
Repeating the same thoughts again and again

Again and again
You said we couldnt last long enough or be strong enough
Again and again
You said our voices werent loud enough but weve had enough because
We want our future back We want our own mistakes to take our own path
We wanna do it again

Again and again
You said we couldnt last long enough or be strong enough
Again and again
You said our voices werent loud enough but weve had enough because
We want our future back We want our own mistakes to take our own path
We wanna do it again

Again and again
You said we couldnt last long enough or be strong enough
Again and again
You said our voices werent loud enough but weve had enough because
We want our future back We want our own mistakes to take our own path
We wanna do it again and again
You said we couldnt last long enough or be strong enough
Again and again
You said our voices werent loud enough but weve had enough because
We want our future back We want our own mistakes to take our own path
We wanna do it again

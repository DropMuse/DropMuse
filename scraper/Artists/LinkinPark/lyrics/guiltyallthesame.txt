Guilty All The Same

Tell us all again
What you think we should be
What the answers are
What it is we cant see
Tell us all again
How to do what you say
How to fall in line
How theres no other way
But oh we all know

Youre guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But theres no one else to blame

Youre guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But theres no one else to blame

Youre guilty all the same

Show us all again
That our hands are unclean
That were unprepared
That you have what we need
Show us all again
Cause we cannot be saved
Cause the end is near
Now theres no other way
And oh you will know

Youre guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But theres no one else to blame

Youre guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But theres no one else to blame

Theres no one else to blame
Guilty all the same

Guilty all the same
Youre guilty all the same

Rakim
Yeah you already know what it is
Can yall explain what kind of land is this when a man has plans of being rich
But the bosses plans is wealthy
Dirty money scheme a clean split is nonsense
Its insane
Even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts assets and realty
At anybodys expense
No shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free
They claim that aint the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowing as soon as the dough or the deal peak
They say its time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if its more to gain
Drained manipulated like artists its real deep
Until no more remains but Im still me
Like authentic hiphop and rock
Til pop and radio and record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be
You feel me well see that green could be to blame
Or greedy for the fame
TV or a name
The media the game
To me youre all the same
Youre guilty

Youre guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But theres no one else to blame

Youre guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But theres no one else to blame
Theres no one else to blame

Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same

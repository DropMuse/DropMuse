Big Pimpin' / Papercut

Ha Ha
Youre wasting your talent Randy

Its like Im paranoid lookin over my back
Its like a whirlwind inside of my head
Its like I cant stop what Im hearing within
Its like the face inside is right 

Why does it feel like night today
Something in heres not right today
Why am I so uptight today
Paranoias all I got left
I dont know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
And watches everything

So I know that when its time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right beneath my skin 

Its like Im paranoid lookin over my back
Its like a whirlwind inside of my head
Its like I cant stop what Im hearing within
Its like the face inside is right

You know I  thug em fuck em love em leave em
Cause I dont fuckin need em
Take em out the hood keep em lookin good
But I dont fuckin feed em
First time they fuss Im breezin
Talkin bout Whats the reasons
Im a pimp in every sense of the word bitch
Better trust than believe em
In the cut where I keep em
til I need a nut til I need to beat the guts
Then its beep beep and Im pickin em up
Let em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head Ima break bread
so you can be livin it up Shit I
parts with nothin yall be frontin
Me give my heart to a woman
Not for nothin never happen
Ill be forever mackin
Heart cold as assassins I got no passion
I got no patience
And I hate waitin
Hoe get yo ass in

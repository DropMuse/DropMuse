I'll Be Gone (Schoolboy Remix)

Like shining oil this night is dripping down
Stars are slipping down glistening
And Im trying not to think what Im leaving now
No deceiving now
Its time you let me know
Let me know

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence
Ill be gone
Ill be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow
Ill be gone
Ill be gone

Ill be gone
Ill be gone
Ill be gone

This air between us is getting thinner now
Into winter now bittersweet
And cross that horizon this sun is setting down
And youre forgetting now
Its time you let me go
Let me go

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence
Ill be gone
Ill be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow
Ill be gone
Ill be gone

And tell them I couldnt help myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh tell me I am the only one
And theres nothing that can stop me Ill be gone

Ill be gone
Ill be gone

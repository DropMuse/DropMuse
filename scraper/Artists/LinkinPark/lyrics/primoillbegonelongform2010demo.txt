Primo (I'll Be Gone, Longform 2010 Demo)

Like shinning oil this night is dripping down
Night is dripping down
Glistening
And Im trying not to think what Im leaving now
Cause Im leaving now
Its time you let me go
Let me go

Till then carry on
And miss me when Im gone
Oh dont let anyone give you away
Just carry on
And miss me when Im gone
Oh dont let anyone take my place
Take my place

This tear between us is getting thinner now
Getting thinner now
Bittersweet
And cross that horizon this sun is setting now
Slowly setting now
Its time to let me go
Let me go

Till then carry on
And miss me when Im gone
Oh dont let anyone give you away
Just carry on
And miss me when Im gone
Oh dont let anyone take my place
Take my place

Just carry on
And miss me when Im gone
Oh dont let anyone give you away
Just carry on
And miss me when Im gone
Oh dont let anyone take my place
Take my place

Tell them I couldnt help myself
And tell them I was alone
Tell them I was the only one
And theres nothing that can stop me from going home

Tell them I couldnt help myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh tell them I was the only one
And theres nothing that can stop me
From going home

Oh tell them I was the only one
And theres nothing that can stop me
From going home

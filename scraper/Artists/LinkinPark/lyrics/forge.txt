Forget

I cannot deal again
I dont want to show my face to
the world today
Its like two different people live
inside of me
And youre so perfect
You left me living inside of this hole
I tearing away from my soul
I feel myself losing control
Im living for nothing
What would it be like to live a
day in your life
I want to know
Living for nothing
I cannot deal with the way that I
feel inside
Ive got to know
Living for nothing
I dont want to have to beg for
another way
All I ever really wanted was a
chance to say
That youre not perfect
You left me living inside of this hole
Im tearing away from my soul
I feel myself losing control
I living for nothing
What would it be like to live a
day in your live
I want to know
Living for nothing
I cannot deal with the way that I
feel inside
Ive got to know
Living for nothing
I dont wanna show my face
show my face
You left me living inside of this soul
I tearing away from my soul
I feel myself losing control
I living for nothing
What would it be like to live a
day in your life
I want to know
Living for nothing
I cannot deal with the way that I
feel inside
Ive got to know
Living for nothing
I cannot deal I cannot deal
You left me all alone
I cannot deal I cannot deal
And I think for nothing
I cannot deal I cannot deal
You left me all alone
I cannot deal I cannot deal
And I live for nothing

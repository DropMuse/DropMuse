It Goes Through

Oh my sun it wont shine
It wont light up the back of my mind
And these fires they wont burn
But to blacken the memories Ive earned
And these walls are so thin
But they somehow keep holding me in
Cause Ive pushed and I know
Whats to come at the end of this road

Cause it goes through

Well my sun it wont shine
It wont light up the back of my mind
And these fires they dont burn
Except to blacken the memories Ive earned
And these walls are so thin
But they keep on holding me in
Cause Ive pushed and I know
That theres nowhere left to go

Cause it goes through

Cause it goes through

Cause it goes through

Cause it goes through

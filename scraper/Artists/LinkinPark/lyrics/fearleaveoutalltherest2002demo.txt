Fear (Leave Out All The Rest 2002 Demo)

Looked in the ocean
Looked in the sea
Found her often
Watching for me
Left the door open
Left the door wide
As she often
Kept it inside

And if youre badder than fact phone z
phend it back to me
sitting front pitter badder than b
even badder than phint to phone badder
than the patter in friends
who gutter the prat
the friday on the patter you plumped
Youre getting thrown even badder than bomb
Dont trust
And if you dont then youre fighting for what

Chorus
Were fighting for a place
That we can call home
Looking for a way
Not to be alone x2
Not to be alone

Bridge
Dun na na
Dun na na na na na na na
Dun na na
Dun na na na na na na na
Dun na na na na

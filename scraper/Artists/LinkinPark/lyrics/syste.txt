You fell away 
What more can I say 
The feelings evolved 
I wont let it out 
I cant replace 
Your screaming face 
Feeling the sickness inside

Why wont you die 
Your blood in mine
Well be fine
Then your body will be mine

So many words 
Cant describe my face
This feelings evolved
So soon to break out 
I cant relate
to a happy state
feeling the blood run inside

Why wont you die 
Your blood in mine
Well be fine
Then your body will be mine

Why is everything so fucking hard for me 
Keep me down to what you think I should be 
Must you tempt me and provoke the ministry

Keep on trying Ill not die so easily

I will not die

Why is everything so fucking hard for me

I will not die

Why is everything so fucking hard for me

I will not die 

Why wont you die 
Your blood is mine 
Well be fine 
Then your body will be mine x2

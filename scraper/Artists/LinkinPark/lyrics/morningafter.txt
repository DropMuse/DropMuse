LinkinPark
Morning After

Caught up against the wall again
Tied and chained to the ball again
Never cease to amaze in minds
So I just sleep sleep sleep please dont
Wake me till the morning after 2x

Cut and bruised by the fall again
Lick my wounds like a dog again
Is that a light at the end of the tunnel
That I see I see please let it be but dont
Wake me till the morning after 3x

Oh Im so tired there has got to be an end
to the pain I feel when Im
awake and alive alive alive
alive and Im dreamin

Caught up against the wall again
Tied and chained to the ball again
Is that a light at the end of the tunnel
That I see I see please let it be but dont
Wake me till the morning after 3x

Oh Im so tired there has got to be an end
to the pain I feel when Im
Awake and alive alive alive
Alive and Im dreamin

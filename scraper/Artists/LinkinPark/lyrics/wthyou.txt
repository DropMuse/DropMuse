Wth&gt;You

Come on

I woke up in a dream today
To the cold and the static
And I put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering Im pretending to be where Im not anymore
A little taste of hipocrisy
And Im left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though youre so close to me
Youre still so distant
And I cant bring you back

Its true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if youre not with me

Im with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
But when things go wrong
I pretend that the past isnt real
Im trapped in this memory
And Im left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though youre so close to me
Youre still so distant
And I cant bring you back

Its true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if youre not with me

Im with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

No I wont let you control my fate
While Im holding the weight of the world on my conscience
No I wont just sit here and wait
While you weighing options
Youre making a fool of me
No you didnt dare try to say that you dont care
And solemnly swear not to follow me there
No it aint like me to beg on my knees
Oh please oh baby please
Thats not how Im doing things
No Im not upset
No Im not angry
I know love is love 
Love and sometimes it pains me
With or without you
Ill always be with you
Youll never forget me
Im keeping you with me
No I wont let you take me to the end of my rope
While you burn it and torture my soul
No Im not your puppet
And no no no I wont let you go

No no matter how far weve come
I cant wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far weve come I
I cant wait to see tomorrow

With you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

Points Of Authority

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You cant run the race
The pace is too fast
You just wont last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life
My pride is broken

Chorus
You like to think youre never wrong
You live what youve learned
You have to act like youre someone
You live what youve learned
You want someone to hurt like you
You live what youve learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what youve learned

You love the things I say Ill do
The way I hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life
My pride is broken

Chorus

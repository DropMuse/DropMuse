I Have Not Begun (2009 Demo)

Ladies and gents sorry to keep yall waiting
This goes out to everybody still hating
For those that fake
yall can keep on fakin
Im cooking a plate for you to stick your whole face in
Tastes good dont it cousin just so you know its nothin
I get you buggin like some codiene in some robutussin
Its just the way that I approach each time
I slap the track and turn around and choke each rhyme
Broadcast to the nation like NBC
With pages of 16s like an MPC
Deliver an asswhipping via MP3
Giving you people more reality than MTV
Do it PPV
snap necks with the pressure
Make a mess
then carry you out on a stretcher
You could sue but
ooh the law wont protect ya
Even the court room sketcher could not sketch ya
Youre not following me
I got your number like
Caller ID
try it
you can holler at me
I promise you pain
I will chop your body in threes
And youll be sitting there stuttering
ppprobabably
Follow me
I got styles
you can copy one
Back of your mind
I know you wanna stop me son
But heres news for you fucker that can not be done
You can think that Im finished I have not begun
Im grinding
putting these kids to bed
You think youre hardboiled
fucker youre an easter egg
You got a pastel shell and a soft inside
squash your pride
You think I fucking lost my mind
Im not playing
I might as well be making a bomb
I lay you down to foundation when Im taking you on
Bet the farm on the rhyme for the sake of my mom
Shes like
Mike show these pigs what kind of bacon youre on
Its funny but dont laugh
money with no cash
The villain of vocab
Im killing this notepad
The realest I wrote man
you dont even know half
Im banking a full tank
youre running on low gas
Take that
Im cutting off your fun
Youre nothing but a butter knife stopping a gun
We can dance but your chances are slim to none
And you can think that Im finished I have not begun
Got a razorblade tongue and I get this done
No running just dumping on your clique for fun
Machine Shop got it locked like the games a joke
Say something funny get the whole gang provoked
Better buckle down fucker
go get your own
We been working ten years just to get this known
The people on the block starting to get numb
They expect that its fresh when the new shit come
Here it goes let em know they can fix the frown
Railroad rap hot tracks running you down
And they ask and repeat how I do this now
Like Im really gonna tell em how I get this sound
We just do what we do give you that fix
We come in the back like we run this bitch
Turn the lights down low
and we start the show
When I give it to ya
give it right back and it goes
Take that
take that
cutting off your fun
Youre nothing but a butter knife stopping a gun
We can dance but your chances are slim to none
You can think that Im finished I have not begun
Follow me
I got styles
you can copy one
Back of your mind
I know you wanna stop me son
But heres news for you fucker that can not be done
You can think that Im finished I have not begun

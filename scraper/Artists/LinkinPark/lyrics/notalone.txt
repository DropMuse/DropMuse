Not Alone

I break down fear is sinking in
The cold comes racing through my skin
Searching for a way to get to you
Through the storm you

Go giving up your home
Go leaving all youve known
You are not alone

With arms up stretched into the sky
With eyes like echos in the night
Hiding from the hell that youve been through
Silent one you

Go giving up your home
Go leaving all youve known
You go giving up your home
Go leaving all youve known
You are not alone

You go giving up your home
Go leaving all youve known

You go giving up your home
Go you are not unknown
You are not alone
You are not unknown
You are not alone

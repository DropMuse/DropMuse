It's Going Down

Woman
Intro
I knew I was being threatened
Do you think it was worth holding out
I mean Ive heard some pretty ugly things about those guys
Ugly stories

Xecutioners
Watch them flee watch them flee
Rap rap rap up
Watch them flee
HipHop hits
And you do it like this

Mike Shinoda
Verse 1
Its going down
The rhythm projects round the next sound
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now
Detects the mesh of many elements compressed down
The melting pot of a superfuturesque style
The combination of vocal caress
With lungs the gasp for breath
From emotional stress
With special effects
And a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage

Prechrus x2
Its going down
The logical progression on the timeline
The seperation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey
Now its going down
A logical progression on the timeline
The seperation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey
Now its going down

Chorus Xecutioners with Mike Shinoda
Put it out for the world to see
LP and XMen to the 10th degree Its goin down
Nobody in the world is safe
When we melt down the wax in your record crate Its going down

Mike Shinoda
Verse 3
Once again it is
Composed sentences
All together venomous
The four elements of natural force
Projected daily through the sound of the source
Everybody on board as we blend
The sword with the pen
The mightiest the weapons
Swinging right from the chin
To elevate of mental states
Long gone with the wind
To defend men from shoddy imitation pretends
Its going down
Style assimilation readily
Trekking through the weaponry
Of the pure pedigree
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me
Whatever the weather be
We invent the steadily
Its going down subterrestrial high
I rhyme regiment thats calling the shots
Exectution of colloborative plots
Ready to bring the seperation of style to a stop

Prechorus

Chorus Xecutioners with Mike Shinoda

Xecutioners
Xmen bout to blast off world wide
Yo its a request only
Xmen bout to blast off world wide

Xecutioners

And you do it like this

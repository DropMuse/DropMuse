Fo shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was herbin em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short wit cheese I would work wit them
Boy and wegot rid of that dirt for them
Wasnt born hustlers I was burpin em
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Fo sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy
Cant leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it aint easy
Cops wanna knock me DA wanna box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Not guilty he who does not feel me is not real to me
Therefore he doesnt exist

One thing I dont know why
It doesnt even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
Its so unreal
I Didnt look out below
I Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on and didnt even know
Wasted it all just to
Watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so

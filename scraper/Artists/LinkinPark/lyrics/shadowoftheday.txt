LinkinPark
Shadow Of The Day

I close both locks below the window
I close both blinds and turn away

Sometimes solutions arent so simple
Sometimes goodbyes the only way

Chorus
And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey

And the sun will set for you
End Chorus

In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay

Sometimes beginnings arent so simple
Sometimes goodbyes the only way

Chorus
And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey

And the sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey

And the sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey

And the sun will set for you
End Chorus

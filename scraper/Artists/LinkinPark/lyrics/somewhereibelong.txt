Somewhere I Belong

When this began
I had nothing to say
And I get lost in the nothingness inside of me
I was confused
And I let it all out to find
That Im not the only person with these things in mind
Inside of me
But all that they can see the words revealed
Is the only real thing that Ive got left to feel
Nothing to lose
Just stuck hollow and alone
And the fault is my own and the fault is my own

Chorus
I wanna heal I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain Ive felt so long
Erase all the pain till its gone
I wanna heal I wanna feel like Im close to something real
I wanna find something Ive wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

And Ive got nothing to say
I cant believe I didnt fall right down on my face
I was confused
Looking everywhere only to find
That its not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
So what am I
What do I have but negativity
Cause I cant justify the way everyone is looking at me
Nothing to lose
Nothing to gain hollow and alone
And the fault is my own and the fault is my own

Repeat Chorus

I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything till I break away from me
I will break away Ill find myself today

Repeat Chorus

I wanna heal I wanna feel like Im somewhere I belong
I wanna heal I wanna feel like Im somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong

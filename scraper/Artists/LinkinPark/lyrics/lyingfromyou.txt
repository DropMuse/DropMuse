Lying From You

When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend I cant forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just cause I know I can but
I cant pretend this is the way itll stay Im just
trying to bend the truth
I cant pretend Im who you want me to be so Im

Chorus
Lying my way from you
No no turning back now
I wanna be pushed aside so let me go
No no turning back now
Let me take back my lifeId rather be all alone
No turning back now
Anywhere on my own cause I can see
No no turning back now
The very worst part of you is me

I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin in
And now you think this person really is me and Im
Trying to bend the truth
But the more I push the more Im pulling away cause Im

Chorus
Lying my way from you
No no turning back now
I wanna be pushed aside so let me go
No no turning back now
Let me take back my life Id rather be all alone
No turning back now
Anywhere on my own cause I can see
No no turning back now
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is ME

This isnt what I wanted to be I never thought that what I said would
have you running from me
Like This
This isnt what I wanted to be I never thought that what I said would
have you running from me
Like This
This isnt what I wanted to be I never thought that what I said would
have you running from me
Like This
This isnt what I wanted to be I never thought that what I said would
have you running from me
Like This

Chorus
You
No turning back now
I wanna be pushed aside so let me go
No no turning back now
Let me take back my life Id rather be all alone
No turning back now
Anywhere on my own cause I can see
No no turning back now
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is me

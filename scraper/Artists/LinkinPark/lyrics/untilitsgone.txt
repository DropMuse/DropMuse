Until It's Gone

A fire needs a space to burn
A breath to build a glow
Ive heard it said a thousand times
But now I know

That you dont know what youve got
Oh you dont know what youve got
No you dont know what youve got
Until its gone
Until its gone
Until its gone

I thought I kept you safe and sound 
I thought I made you strong 
But something made me realize
That I was wrong

Cause finding what you got sometimes
Means finding it alone 
And I can finally see your light 
When I let go

Cause you dont know what youve got
Until its gone
Until its gone
Until its gone

Until its gone
Until its gone
Until its gone
Until its gone
Until its gone

Cause you dont know what youve got
Oh you dont know what youve got
No you dont know what youve got
Its your battle to be fought
No you dont know what youve got
Til its gone
Til its gone
Til its gone

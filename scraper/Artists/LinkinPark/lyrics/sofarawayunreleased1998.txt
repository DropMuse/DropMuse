So Far Away (Unreleased 1998)

Verse
Save me now from this mess that Ive created
All The souls have gone and Im stranded here with doubt and fear alone
Tell me how Im in fault for all this madness
I dont know whats wrong but I cannot help but try to push it

Chorus
So Far Away
In so deep and inside of me
So Hard to say
I dont want to say it anyway

Verse
Save me now Im the mess I have created
And my soul has gone and for some reason all I do is push it

Chorus
So Far Away
In so deep and inside of me
So Hard to say
I dont want to say it anyway
So far away

Its so far away
In so deep and inside of me
So Hard to say
I dont want to say it anyway

So Far Away
In so deep and inside of me
So Hard to say
I dont want to say it anyway

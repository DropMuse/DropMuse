Robot Boy (Test Mix, Option Vocal Take)

You say youre not gonna fight cause no one will fight for you
Cause you think theres not enough love and no one to give it to
And you say that faith is a lie and fear is your only truth
And youre sure that everyone else is feeling the way you do
You say youve hurt for so long that pain isnt something new
But dont think the things that theyve done predict what youre going to do
The truth is that trust is a gift its something we all can lose
So hold on its not where it goes its where it can lead you to
Hold on Its not where it goes its where it can lead you to

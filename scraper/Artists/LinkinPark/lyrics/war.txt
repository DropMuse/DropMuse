War

One two one two thank you

Theres no peace
Only war
Victory decides whos wrong or right
It will not cease
Only grow
You better be prepared to fight

And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

War

Theres no pain
It will spare
Fear has become your only right
And once youre lost
In your despair
Forever black eternal night

And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

War
Destroy you
War
Destroy you

It needs no side to justify
Laying down your life

War
Destroyer

War

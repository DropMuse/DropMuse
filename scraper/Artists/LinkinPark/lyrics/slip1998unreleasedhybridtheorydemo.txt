LinkinPark
Slip (1998 Unreleased Hybrid Theory Demo)

In the center of the silence 
The violent thoughts are thrown through
The thick smoke of flickering lights that brighten the room
All the things that you wanted to say get lost and thrown away
You can fade and hesitate to speak your mind
Cant turn back when you cross the line
Sometimes someone you know who just doesnt care
Has to see you go to know you were there

This is the summer of the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I cant stand another minute
Made the gun to run and end this race
But I never look back and I forget it
Know that this is the summer of the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I cant stand another minute
Made the gun to run and end this race
But I never look back and I forget it

I know that all of this will soon be gone
You dont really have to prove them wrong

Sometimes you got no control of where you go
Taken down a road you dont know
And you feel so lost you want to hide your face
You dont recognize the place your in
Sometimes the sun doesnt shine your way
Sometimes the night doesnt turn to day
But sometimes the lights so bright it burns through the night
And keeps the darkness at bay Run away

This is the summer of the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I cant stand another minute
Made the gun to run and end this race 
But I never look back when I forget it
Know that this is the summer of the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I cant stand another minute
Made the gun to run and end this race
But I never look back when I forget it

I know that all of this will soon be gone
You dont really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough youll make them see
Youll be far away from them with me

Follow the link in the chain without a name
Steal the light that darkens these remains
Take it away to the place youve been trapped
Break all you know to bring it all back

This is the summer of the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I cant stand another minute
Made the gun to run and end this race 
But I never look back when I forget it
Know that this is the summer of the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I cant stand another minute
Made the gun to run and end this race
But I never look back when I forget it

I know that all of this will soon be gone
You dont really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough youll make them see
Youll be far away from them
Alone with me

LinkinPark
Asbestos (Minutes To Midnight Demo)

Dont start with the ugly part dont end with the things that will make them want to walk away
Tune in at the din again another price aint cheap but somebodys gonna have to pay
Oh yes you can only guess what it is what it was dont remember what I had in mind
Shotgunning on a joy ride coming down the block halfcocked nearly half the time

Give it back give it back give it back gggive it back sing it

One time for the words divine and two times for the things that you hope you never have to say
Three scenes in a dead mans dream and the girls tell the boys that they better fucking run away
Live it up or gggive it up turn it up tune it out let it rhyme with the other line
Shotgunning on a joy ride coming down the block halfcocked nearly all the time

Give it back give it back give it back gggive it back sing it

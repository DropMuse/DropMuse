Rolling In The Deep

Theres a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and Ill lay your shit bare
See how Ill leave with every piece of you
Dont underestimate the things that I will do

Theres a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And its bringing me out the dark

Chorus
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I cant help feeling
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
Youre gonna wish you never had met me
And you played it to the beat
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep

Baby I have no story to be told
But Ive heard one of you
And Im gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there
As mine sure wont be shared

Chorus
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I cant help feeling
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
Youre gonna wish you never had met me
And you played it to the beat
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

Youre gonna wish you never had met me
We could have had it all
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
We could have had it all
Youre gonna wish you never had met me
It all it all it all
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep

We could have had it all
Youre gonna wish you never had met me
Rolling in the deep
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
Youre gonna wish you never had met me
And you played it to the beat
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep

You could have had it all
Youre gonna wish you never had met me
Rolling in the deep
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
Youre gonna wish you never had met me

But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat

Waiting For The End

Mike
Yeah
Yo
This is not the end this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady something emptys within them
We say yeah with fists flying up in the air
Like were holding onto something thats invisible there
Cause were living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we get it forget it let it all disappear

Chester
Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
Its out of my control
Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
Its hard to let you go

Oh I know what it takes to move on
Oh I know how it feels to lie
Oh All I want to do
Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I havent got

Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasnt so

Oh I know what it takes to move on
Oh I know how it feels to lie
Oh All I want to do
Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I havent got

Yeah yeah

Mike
What was left when that fire was gone
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what its like moving on
And I dont even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So Im picking up the pieces now where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

Ohohohohohoh

Chester til end
All I want to do
Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I havent got
Im holding on to what I havent got
Im holding on to what I havent got

Mike
This is not the end this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
Im holding on to what I havent got But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Though the words sound steady something emptys within them
We say yeah with fists flying up in the air
Like were holding onto something thats invisible there
Holding on to what I havent got Cause were living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we get it forget it let it all disappear

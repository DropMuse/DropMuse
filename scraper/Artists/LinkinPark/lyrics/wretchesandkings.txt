Wretches And Kings

Theres a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious makes you so sick at heart that you cant take part you cant even passively take part and youve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels upon the levers upon all the apparatus and youve got to make it stop
Mario Savio

To save face  how low can you go
Talk a lot of game but yet you dont know
Static on the way  make us all say whoa
The people up top push the people down low
Get down
And obey every word
Steady getting mine if you havent yet heard
Wanna take what I got  dont be absurd
Dont fight the power  nobody gets hurt
If you havent heard yet then Im letting you know
There aint shit we dont run when the guns unload
And no one make a move unless my people say so
Got everything outta control
Now everybody go

Steel unload  final blow
We the animals take control
Hear us now  clear and true
Wretches and kings we come for you

So keep pace  how slow can you go
Talk a lot of shit and yet you dont know
Fire on the way  make you all say whoa
The people up top and the people down low
Get down
And Im running it like that
The front of the attack is exactly where Im at
Somewhere in between the kick and the hi hat
The pen and the contract
The pitch and the contact
So get with the combat  Im letting em know
There aint shit you can say to make me back down no
So  push the button let the whole thing blow
Spinning everything outta control
Now everybody go

Steel unload  final blow
We the animals take control
Hear us now  clear and true
Wretches and kings we come for you

Steel unload  fire blow
Filthy animals  beat them low
Skin and bone  black and blue
No more this sun shall beat onto you

From the front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put em up real high

when the operation of the machine becomes so odious makes you so sick at heart that you cant take part you cant even passively take part and youve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels upon the levers upon all the apparatus and youve got to make it stop And youve got to indicate to the people who run it to the people who own it that unless youre free the machine will be prevented from working at all

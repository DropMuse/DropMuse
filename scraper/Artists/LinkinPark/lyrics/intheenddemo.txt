In The End (Demo)

It starts with one
then multiplies til you can taste the sun
And burned by the sky you try to take it from
But if it falls theres no place to run
Crumbling down its so unreal
Theyre dealing you in to determine your end
And sending you back again to places youve been
And bending your will til it breaks you within
And still they fill their eyes
With the twilight through the skylight
And the highlights on a frame of steel
See the brightness of your likeness
As I write this on a pad with the way I feel
Hear the screaming in my dreaming
As its seeming that youve played your part
Like youre heartless take apart this
In the darkness but I know that

Ive tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesnt even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesnt even matter

Ive looked down the line
And whats there is not what ought to be
Held back by the battles they fought for me
Calling me to be part of their property
And now I see that I get no chance I get no break
Fakes and snakes quickly lead to mistakes
And as the tightrope within slowly starts to thin
I can only hope that they close their eyes
To the twighlight through the skylight
And the highlights on a frame of steel
See the brightness of your likeness
As I write this on a pad to the way I feel
Hear the screaming in my dreaming
As its seeming that youve played your part
Like youre heartless take apart this
In the darkness but I know that

Ive tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesnt even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesnt even matter

I put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
Theres only one thing you should know

Ive put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
Theres only one thing you should know

Ive tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesnt even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesnt even matter

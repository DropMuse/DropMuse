Lost In The Echo (Killsonik Remix)

And these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go go go

This time I finally let you

Test my will test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Yall go hard I go smart
Hows that working out for yall in the back huh
Ive seen that frustration
Been crossed and lost and told No
And Ive come back unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
So you can let it be known
I dont hold back I hold my own
I cant be mapped I cant be cloned
I cant Cflat it aint my tone
I cant fall back I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
Cause I was there saying

And these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you go
Go go go

Oh oh oh

This time I
This time I
This time I
This time I
This time I
This time I finally let you go

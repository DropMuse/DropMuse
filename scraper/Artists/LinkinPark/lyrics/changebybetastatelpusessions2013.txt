Change (By Beta State, LPU Sessions 2013)

Here I wait for a good thing to resolve
When Im sinking in a ship I cant control
And Im sick with a smile I try and hide
Broken pieces of a lie I cant let go

I never meant to let you down again
I had it all but watched it drown

Why does every good thing have to end
Ive burned every bridge before it began and now Im sinking
I changed a man I thought Id never be
Ive burned every bridge before it began I swear Im gonna change

Here I wait swimming in a sea of dark
Im lost in the current of my faults
Here I sink holding on with all I had
The tide will rise Im gonna own whats mine

I never meant to let you down again
I had it all but watched it drown

Why does every good thing have to end
Ive burned every bridge before it began and now Im sinking
I changed a man I thought Id never be
Ive burned every bridge before it began I swear Im gonna change

All I wanna do is break free
All I wanna do is break free

I never meant to let you down again
I had it all but watched it drown

Why does every good thing have to end
Ive burned every bridge before it began and now Im sinking
I changed a man I thought Id never be
Ive burned every bridge before it began I swear Im gonna change

I swear Im gonna change

all I want to do is break free
all I want to do is break free I swear Im going to change

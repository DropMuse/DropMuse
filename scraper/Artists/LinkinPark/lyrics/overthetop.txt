Over The Top

Hear the voices in my head
I pretend its all okay
Do you hear the voices in my head
Always
When you consider a war
Cos you dont get what you want to
Remember the fact
You dont know what Im in for
Squeeze the hex you breathe in me
And theres nothing undesired
Hey dont try to understand
They take the upper hand
Do you hear the voices in my head
Always
Always oh yeah
Chorus
I try so hard but I can never find
The answers lost upon the other side
Im bleeding out before Im coming out
Didnt mean to break in on the outside
I try so hard but I can never find
The answers lost upon the other side
Im bleeding out before Im coming out
Didnt mean to break in on the outside
Here Im locked inside my head
You cant help me understand
Do you hear the voices in my head
Deny the things I say always
When you dream of a fan
Cos you dont know where they come from
Consider the facts
When theyre moving in behind ya
Squeeze the hex you breathe in me
And theres nothing we deny ya
Chorus
Do you hear the voices in my head 4x
Chorus 2x

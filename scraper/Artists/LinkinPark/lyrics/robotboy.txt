You say youre not gonna fight
Cause no one would fight for you
And you think theres not enough love
And no one to give it to
And youre sure youve hurt for so long
Youve got nothing left to lose
So you say youre not gonna fight
Cause no one would fight for you

You say the weight of the world
Has kept you from letting go
And you think compassions a flaw
And youll never let it show
And youre sure youve hurt in a way
That no one will ever know
But someday the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go

Hold on the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go
So hold on the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go
So hold on the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go
Just hold on the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go

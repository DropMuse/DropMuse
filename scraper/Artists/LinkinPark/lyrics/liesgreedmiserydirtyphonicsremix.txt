I wanna see you choke on your lies lies lies
Suffer all alone in your lone in your lone in your
Choke on your lies lies lies
Suffer all alone in your misery

Choke on your lies lies lies
Suffer all alone in your lone in your lone in your
Choke on your lies lies lies
Suffer all alone in your misery

Imma be that nail in your coffin
Sayin that I soften
I was duckin down to reload
So you can save your petty explanations
I dont have the patience
Before you even say it I know
You let your pride or your ego
Talk slick to me no
That is not the way I get down
And look at how you lose your composure
Now let me show you
Exactly how the breaking point sounds

I wanna see you
Exactly how the breaking point sounds

That is not the way I get down
That is not the way it goes down
That is not the way I get down
That is not the way it goes down

Thththat is not the way I get down
That is not the way it goes down
That is not the way I get down
That is not the way it goes down

Blackout

C Bennington
Im stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets youve been keeping
Its written upon your face
All the lies how they cut so deeply
You cant get enough you take
And take and take and never say

No  youve gotta get it inside
You push it back down  You push it back down 
No  youll never get it inside 
Push it back down  Black out  Blood in your eye

You say that its not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said its not what it seems
No remorse for the trust youre breaking 
You run but then back you fall
Suffocate in the mess youre making
You cant get enough you take
And take and take and take and take
Fuck it
Are you listening

No  youve gotta get it inside
You push it back down  You push it back down 
No  youll never get it inside 
Push it back down  You push it back down 
No  youve gotta get it inside 
You push it back down  You push it back down 
No  youll never get it inside 
Push it back down  Black out  Blood in your eye

M Shinoda
Floating down  as colors fill the light 
We look up from the ground  in fields of paperwhite 
And floating up  you pass us in the night 
A future gazing out  a past to overwrite 
So come down  far below 
Weve been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down  far below 
Weve been waiting to collect what youve let go

M Shinoda and C Bennington
Come down oh
Come down oh
Come down
Come down oh
Come down oh

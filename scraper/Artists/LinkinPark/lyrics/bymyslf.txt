What do I do to ingore them behind me
Do I follow my instincts blindly
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them redhanded
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust nobody and live in lonliness
Because I cant hold on when Im stretched so thin
I make the right moves but Im lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again

By myself
Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I cant rely on myself
Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I cant rely on myself

I cant look around
Its too much to take in
I cant hold back
When Im stretched so thin
I cant slow down
Watching everything spin
I cant look back
Starting over again

If I turn my back Im defenceless
And to go blindly seems senceless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then theyll take from me til everything is gone
If I let them go Ill be outdone
But if I try to catch them Ill be outrun
If Im killed by the questions like a cancer
Then Ill be buried in the silence of the answer

By myself
Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I cant rely on myself
Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I cant rely on myself

I cant look around
Its too much to take in
I cant hold back
When Im stretched so thin
I cant slow down
Watching everything spin
I cant look back
Starting over again

Dont you know
I cant tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do how hard I try
I cant seem to convince myself why
Im stuck on the outside

I cant tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do how hard I try
I cant seem to convince myself why
Im stuck on the outside

No matter what I do how hard I try
I cant seem to convince myself why
Im stuck on the outside

I cant tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do how hard I try
I cant seem to convince myself why
Im stuck on the outside

Dont you know
I cant tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do how hard I try
I cant seem to convince myself why
Im stuck on the outside

Dont you know
I cant tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do how hard I try
I cant seem to convince myself why
Im stuck on the outside

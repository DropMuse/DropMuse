LinkinPark
Chance Of Rain (2006 Demo)

She had never really understood
She demanded her respect
Twenty years of falling underfoot
Twenty reasons to regret

You would look for what you couldnt see
Scared to be what she became
She would tell you what you couldnt be 
Its why you had yourself to blame

Alone again
You tried to disappear
And hold it in
Pretending not to hear

This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down
Youre trying not to fear
Saying this is in your head
But it whispers in your ear
Saying this is what you get 

She was ready with your penalty
When eventually youd fall
She was there inside your memory
Saying this was all your fault

Alone again
You tried to disappear
And hold it in
Pretending not to hear

This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down
Youre trying not to fear
Saying this is in your head
But it whispers in your ear
Saying this is what you get

Alone again
Its all becoming clear
You hold it in
Pretending not to hear

This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down 
Youre trying not to fear 
Saying this is in your head 
But it whispers in your ear 
Saying this is what you get 

This voice without a sound 
Voice without a sound 
This voice without a sound without a sound
Voice without a sound without a sound

Fuse

Spoken
Of course you know what a fuse is 
Its a long piece of cord impregnated with gun powder 
When you strike a match and light it 
It burns fitfully spiraling to its end 
At which there is a little surprise 

Krypton short suit MCs youll be ripped on 
You fell off and its my lyric sheet you just slipped on 
Get gone spit on mics made in Hong Kong 
Rock on sing songs mightier than King Kong 
A Donkey you think you want me or want this 
Want some hold your reputation for Ransom 
With these here handsomely crafted tactics 
To break a snake and see like a cheap profilactic 
Galactic space now yeah that grabs attention 
Crack heads nodded like a pest cant even mention 
Right a pat traps gas tracks in sections 
Kid steps this he need witness protection 

Trying to see what I cant be seeing
Ill be here 
Trying to see what I cant be seeing
Ill be here

It was the junkyard crooked letter CIentific 
Duck us the ruckus Ill bring stings your eardrum 
Hear one lalala loose frind me fearsome 
Opposing troops on my home front shall be gone 
Testing the eighthundred eighteenth battalion 
Shallow the one whos run like rebels 
Enola gay rhymes kicked the notch up a level 
In intensity send back the tax that you sent to me 
Blow up your spot with grenades that were meant for me 
MP3 versus R33 MCs Swiss change your gear putting shrapnel in the breeze 
Were MCs with enemy companies with my hand full of lyrics talking bout you want these 
Please dont even speak the name of channels and low gadget mic shit put it down like pens 
For my friends and my fam let them dodge it around this mic shot through the back of an MCs hand 
With the strength that he had a bridge you dont want that close body fields in hand to hand combat 
Battle cats its like the sectional speech warfare words slash cords 
Come deford shots get rid dont question my intention when your butt gets kicked

Trying to see what I cant be seeing
Ill be here 
Tech broke italic syllabalic attacks 
Trying to see what I cant be seeing
Ill be here 
You want these MCs lyrically back smacks 

Go ahead
Suit yourself

Why wait I didnt look down myself 
Why wait I didnt look down myself
Why wait I didnt look down myself
Why wait I didnt look down myself
Why wait I didnt look down myself
Why wait I didnt look down myself
Why wait I didnt look down myself
Why wait I didnt look down myself

Trying to see what I cant be seeing
Ill be here 
Tech broke italic syllabalic attacks 
Trying to see what I cant be seeing
Ill be here 
You want these MCs lyrically back smacks

Ten Dollars And A Six Pack

You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldnt have
You were country lovin really somethin for three months and a half

Everybody said that you were bad news
but baby I was betting on you

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now Im gonna have to listen to my mummas I told you so
But you werent even worth all that ten dollars and a six pack

I said let them say were crazy you said lets go fishing a lot
The midnight moon was blazing baby I was gazing into your eyes

Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now Im gonna have to listen to my mummas I told you so
But you werent even worth all that ten dollars and a six pack

Cant believe the time you lost me
Cant believe what it cost me

Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
I had to listen to my mummas I told you so
You aint never been through that
You aint worth all that ten dollars and a six pack
You aint worth all that ten dollars and a six pack

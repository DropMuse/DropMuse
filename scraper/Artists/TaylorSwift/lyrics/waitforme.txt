Wait For Me

If you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me

If I wasnt scared of the world alone
If I didnt know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
Youd be with me so baby

Dont you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

Its so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go cause he dont know
But the writings on the wall

But here we are in so deep
Soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I dont know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall so baby

Dont you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait wait for me

We cant be together right now
Guess theres no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that Im dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to

So dont you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

Dont you look now
Dont you look now
I might fall in love
Dont you look now

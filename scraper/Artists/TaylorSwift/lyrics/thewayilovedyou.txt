The Way I Loved You

He is sensible and so incredible 
And all my single friends are jealous 
He says everything I need to hear and its like 
I couldnt ask for anything better 
He opens up my door and I get into his car 
And he says you look beautiful tonight 
And I feel perfectly fine 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And its 2am and Im cursing your name 
Youre so in love that you act insane 
And thats the way I loved you 
Breakin down and coming undone 
Its a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And thats the way I loved you 

He respects my space 
And never makes me wait 
And he calls exactly when he says he will 
Hes close to my mother 
Talks business with my father 
Hes charming and endearing 
And Im comfortable 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And its 2am and Im cursing your name 
Youre so in love that you act insane 
And thats the way I loved you 
Breakin down and coming undone 
Its a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And thats the way I loved you 

He cant see the smile Im faking 
And my hearts not breaking 
Cause Im not feeling anything at all 
And you were wild and crazy 
Just so frustrating intoxicating 
Complicated got away by some mistake and now 

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
Its 2am and Im cursing your name 
Im so in love that I acted insane 
And thats the way I loved you 
Breaking down and coming undone 
Its a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And thats the way I loved you oh oh 

And thats the way I loved you oh oh 
Never knew I could feel that much 
And thats the way I loved you

Angelina

Angelinas got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
Ive never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I dont cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say
I wasnt brought up that way

Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
Hes got everything youd wanna be
Hes funny dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I wont cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say
I wasnt brought up that way

Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But aint it funny how
It all comes out
Isnt life sweet

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not Im not oh
And Im not perfect you could say
I wasnt brought up that way

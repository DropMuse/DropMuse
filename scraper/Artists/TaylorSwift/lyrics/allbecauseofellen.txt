All Because Of Ellen

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Outrun my gun

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Faster than my bullet

Ellen works a long day
Giving weird interviews in a slick cool sweater
And it gets kinda weird
Yeah calling us like were boyfriend and girlfriend

But its not cause were just sitting here
And we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
And its always gonna get weird
Cause this song is all about Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
Its really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
Its really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

Ive been on this show
Eight times now and I still remember
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could of died

Shes always asks me who Im dating
Every time Im on this show
And I dont even know why
But it gets five million hits on youtube

Cause Every single time I come on this show
Its really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
Its really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

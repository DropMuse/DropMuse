There's Your Trouble

Should have been different but
It wasnt different was it
Same old story dear john 
And so long
Should have fit like a glove
Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didnt
She should be here now
But she isnt

Chorus
Theres your trouble 
Theres your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You cant see I love you 
You cant see she doesnt
But you just keep holding on
Theres your trouble

So now youre thinking bout
All youre missing how
Deep youre sinking 
Round and round and dragging down
Why dont you cash in your chips
Why dont you call it a loss
Not such a big loss 
Chalk it up better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasnt
It should all add up
But it doesnt

Repeat chorus

Should have all worked out
But it didnt
She should be here now
But she isnt

Repeat chorus

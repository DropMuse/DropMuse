My names Gracie
Ill be five in May
Kinda scared cause
I never been on a plane
My mama says that itll be alright
Cause Im gunna see my daddy tonight
And she says that

Theres a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
An I dont wanna get there too soon
And I know theres a God because I met him
And I see it when Im looking at you
There aint no accidents in what we do

My names Heather
Guess were on the same flight
Dont mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
Shes finally well enough to travel
doctor says shes in the clear
Shes been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year

And theres a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
But none of us want to get there too soon
And I know theres a God because I met him
And I see it when Im looking at you
There aint no accidents in what we do

James T Johnson
Thats her daddys name
Hes been overseas
Itll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on

Theres a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
And I dont wanna get there too soon
And I know theres a God because I met him
And I see it when Im looking at you
There aint no accidents in what we do

And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we do

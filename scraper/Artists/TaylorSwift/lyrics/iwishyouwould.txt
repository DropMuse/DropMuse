I Wish You Would

Its 2 AM in your car
Windows down you pass my street the memories start
You say its in the past you drive straight ahead
Youre thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still dont know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
And I wish you knew that Ill never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would

Its 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane I think of you
Were a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that Ill never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would

I I I I I I wish I wish
I I I I I I wish I wish
I I I I I I wish I wish

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would I wish you would
I wish you would I wish you would

I I I I I I wish I wish

2 AM here we are
See your face hear my voice in the dark
Were a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that Ill never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
And I wish you knew that Ill never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would I wish you would
I wish you would I wish you would

I I I I I I wish I wish
I I I I I I wish I wish
I I I I I I wish I wish you would

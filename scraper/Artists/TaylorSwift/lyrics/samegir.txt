Same Girl

Im still wearing my blue jeans
No I dont know what you mean
Im still the same girl
Picking daisies in the field
I believe in what I feel
Ive always been the same girl

Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
Im just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

Ive always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
Ive always been the same girl

I still live in one small town
But always love to move around
Ive always been the same girl
Still keep diaries that say
Where I was and did that day
Ive always been the same girl

Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
Im just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

Ive always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
Ive always been the same girl

Some days will change your life
Yeah this could be one of them
Im just living life and thinking

Ive always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
Ive always been the same girl

Living in the crazy world
Ive always been the same girl

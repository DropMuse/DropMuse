Mean

You with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like a nothing
You with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when Im wounded
You picking on the weaker man

Well you can take me down with just one single blow
But you dont know what you dont know

Someday Ill be living in a big ole city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean

You with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I dont already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out cause Ill never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
Cause you cant lead me down that road
And you dont know what you dont know

Someday Ill be living in a big ole city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobodys listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I cant sing
But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar and pathetic and alone in life
And mean and mean and mean and mean

But someday Ill be living in a big ole city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean yeah
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so

Someday Ill be living in a big ole city Why you gotta be so
And all youre ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me Why you gotta be so
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean

Jump Then Fall

I like the way you sound in the morning
Were on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard

I like the way I cant keep my focus
I watch you talk you didnt notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine Ill shine for you

Whoa oh Im feeling you baby
Dont be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Be there never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
So Imma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face oh
Ive never been so wrapped up honey
I like the way youre everything I ever wanted

I had time to think it all over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath then jump then fall into me
Cause Every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine Ill shine for you

Whoa oh Im feeling you baby
Dont be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Be there never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
So Imma stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet
Ill catch you Ill catch you
And people say things that bring you to your knees
Ill catch you
The time is gonna come when youre so mad you could cry
But Ill hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa oh I need you baby
Dont be afraid please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Be there never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
So Imma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall baby
Jump then fall into me into me

Every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine I shine
And every time youre here
Baby Ill show you Ill show you
You can Jump then fall jump then fall
Jump then fall into me into me yeah

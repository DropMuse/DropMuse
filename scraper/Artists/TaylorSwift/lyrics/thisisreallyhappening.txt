This Is Really Happening

Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and were both not making a sound
Its like Im melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
and

Tell me
Youll never leave me
and Im not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

Could this be better
You write me letters
So you see me everyday
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still cant take my eyes off you

Tell me
Youll never leave me
and Im not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh BabyHere we are

Tell me
Youll never leave me
and Im not crazy and
OhThis is really happening
OhOhBaby

Tell me
Youll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Ohthat this is really happening

Tell meOh
Youll always need me

Baby
That I drive you crazy
Oh
That this is really happening

Innocent

I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin to get it back

Wasnt it easier in your lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasnt it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you

Its alright just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh who you are is not where youve been
Youre still an innocent
Youre still an innocent

Did some things you cant speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldnt be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasnt it easier in your fireflycatchin days
When everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
Wasnt it beautiful runnin wild til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you

Its alright just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh who you are is not what youve been
Youre still an innocent
Its okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growin up now
Who you are is not what you did
Youre still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
Youll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

Its alright just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh who you are is not what youve been
Youre still an innocent
Its okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growin up now
Who you are is not what you did
Youre still an innocent
Youre still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope
Its never too late to get it back

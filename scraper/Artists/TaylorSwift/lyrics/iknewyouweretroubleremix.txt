I Knew You Were Trouble (Remix)

Taylor Swift
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights you got me alone
You found me you found me you found me
I guess you didnt care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me without me without me

And hes long gone when hes next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh Sammy Adams you know Im trouble trouble trouble Sammy Adams you know Im
Oh oh Sammy Adams you know Im trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh Sammy Adams I told you I was I was trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble

Sammy Adams
Double platinum wherever she go
South of France to Reno
Met her out in Vegas
Went in on casino 
Red lips so hard to miss
Whats wrong with being promiscuous
And I can teach you bad bad things
If you into it
Dont need to get intimatejust yet
Slow down I know that 
You thinking you and mejust met 
But girl I got the remedy most important in chemistry
Good girl gone bad too much for a Kennedy

Some say some say they sell they souls for a couple hits
Id rather live a life of gold with a perfect chick
Cause that one moment when your breathless and your hoping
And ya feel the same way same way 
Sparks blowing off that cute face and that shy smileoh man 
I havent crushed this hard in quite a whileoh damn
And I can care less that your famous
We can make the perfect couple
Cause my first name big last name trouble
Yeah

Taylor Swift
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh Sammy Adams you know Im trouble trouble trouble Sammy Adams you know Im
Oh oh Sammy Adams you know Im trouble trouble trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in you were right there you were right there
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble

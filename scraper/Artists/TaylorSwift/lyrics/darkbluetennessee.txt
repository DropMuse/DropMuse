Dark Blue Tennessee

He said I got me a nice new apartment
In a city wouldnt you have hated that
Im getting by with a broken heart you left me with
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Wont you come back to me
Ill be here today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

He was lying when he said he moved to LA
Hes just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and shes just 7 miles away
Hes staring out the window and puts her picture down saying

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Wont you come back to me
Ill be here today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Wont you come back to me
Ill be here today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

In dark blue Tennessee

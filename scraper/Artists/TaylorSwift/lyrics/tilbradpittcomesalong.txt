Til Brad Pitt Comes Along

Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When Im mad at all the lovebirds
Cause they dont know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldnt see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Cause thats where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me
And I threw the remote at you
And you said my point exactly
And later on that night under the neon city lights
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you

When Im mad at all the lovebirds
Cause they dont know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldnt see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Cause thats where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

You call me lucky cause I lose everything
But I swear Id be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When Im mad at all the lovebirds
Cause they dont play our song
I wish that pretty girls wouldnt see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Cause thats where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
Til Brad Pitt comes along
Yeah oh oh
Until Brad Pitt comes along

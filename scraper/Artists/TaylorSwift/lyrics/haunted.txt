Haunted

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought Id live to see it break
Its getting dark and its all too quiet
And I cant trust anything now
And its coming over you like its all a big mistake

Oh Im holding my breath
Wont lose you again
Somethings made your eyes go cold

Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now Im haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time Im wishing he was you instead

Oh Im holding my breath
Wont see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now Im haunted

I know I know I just know
Youre not gone You cant be gone No

Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Wont finish what you started
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant go back Im haunted

Oh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought Id see it break
Never thought Id see it

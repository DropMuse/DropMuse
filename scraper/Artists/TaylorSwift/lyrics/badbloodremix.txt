Bad Blood (Remix)

Chorus  Taylor Swift
Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause baby now we got bad blood hey

Verse 1  Kendrick Lamar
Hey I cant take it back look where Im at
We was on D like DOC remember that Remember that
My TLC was quite OD ID my facts ID my
Now POV of you and me similar Iraq
I dont hate you but I hate to critique overrate you
These beats of a dark heart use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you love dont hear no more
No I dont fear no more better yet respect aint quite sincere no more

PreChorus  Taylor Swift
Oh its so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

Chorus  Taylor Swift
Cause baby now we got bad blood

And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood hey

Verse 2  Kendrick Lamar
Hey Remember when you tried to write me off
Remember when you thought Id take a loss
Dont you remember You thought that I would need yah
Follow procedure remember Oh wait you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds battle scars
Body bumped bruised
Stabbed in the back brimstone fire jumping through
Still all my life I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

PreChorus  Taylor Swift
Oh its so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

And baby now we got bad blood hey

Bridge  Taylor Swift Kendrick Lamar
Bandaids dont fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that you live with ghosts
You forgive you forget but you never let it go
Bandaids dont fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that you live with ghosts
If you love like that blood runs cold

Chorus  Taylor Swift
Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause baby now we got bad blood hey
Now we got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
Think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood hey

Chorus  Taylor Swift
Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love

Cause baby now we got bad blood hey
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood hey

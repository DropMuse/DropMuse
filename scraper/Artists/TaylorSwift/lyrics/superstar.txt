Superstar

This is wrong but I cant help but feel like
There aint nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I cant
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
Id be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

Good morning loneliness comes around when Im not
Dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
Youll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face Id be
Counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

You played in bars you play guitar
Im invisible and everyone knows who you are
And youll never see sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar
Sweet sweet superstar superstar

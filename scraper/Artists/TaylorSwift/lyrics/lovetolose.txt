Love To Lose

Come on gather round Im gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience I didnt mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but its too bad you didnt see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong it was all my fault
I had it all what a shame what a fall now
But in case you havent heard the news
There wasnt much love to lose

Lets talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside
He smiled and I smiled well the cameras in your mind
And I lied I swore that everything was fine

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong it was all my fault
I had it all what a shame what a fall now
But in case you havent heard the news
There wasnt much love to lose

I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong it was all my fault
I had it all what a shame what a fall now
But in case you havent heard the news
There wasnt much love to lose

Come on gather round Im gonna tell you how the fire went out

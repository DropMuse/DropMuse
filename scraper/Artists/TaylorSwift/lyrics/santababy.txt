Santa Baby

Santa baby slip a sable under the tree for me
Ive been an awful good girl santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby a 54 convertible too light blue
Well Ill wait up for you dear santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight yeah

Think of all the fun Ive missed
Think of all the boys I havent kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby I want a yacht and really thats not a lot
Ive been an angel all year santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa honey theres one more thing I really do need the deed
To a platinum mine santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffanys
I really do believe in you
Lets see if you believe in me

Santa baby forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I dont mean on the phone santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

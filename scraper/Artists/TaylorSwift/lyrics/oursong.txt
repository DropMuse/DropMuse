Our Song

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
Hes got a onehand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around turn the radio down
He says Baby is something wrong
I say Nothing
I was just thinking
How we dont have a song
And he says

Chorus
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date Man I didnt kiss her when I should have
And when I got home  fore I said Amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway
Well on my way
To my lovin bed
I almost didnt notice
All the roses
And the note that said

Chorus
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date Man I didnt kiss her when I should have
And when I got home  fore I said Amen
Asking God if he could play it again

Ive heard every album listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

Chorus
Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on his window
When were on the phone and he talks real slow
Cause its late and his mama dont know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date Man I didnt kiss him when I should have
And when I got home  fore I said Amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

Oh yeah
Ohoh yeah

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

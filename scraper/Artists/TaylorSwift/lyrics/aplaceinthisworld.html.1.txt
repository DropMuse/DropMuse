A Place In This World

I dont know what I want so dont ask me
Cause Im still trying to figure it out
Dont know whats down this road Im just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though Im not the only one
Who feels the way I do

Chorus
Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on my old blue jeans
And Im wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrows just a mystery oh yeah
But thats ok

Chorus

Maybe Im just a girl on a mission
But Im ready to fly

Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh Im just a girl
Oh Im just a girl oh oh
Oh Im just a girl

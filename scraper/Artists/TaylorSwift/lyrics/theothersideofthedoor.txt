The Other Side Of The Door

In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said This time Ive had enough
And youve called a hundred times
But Im not picking up

Cause Im so mad I might tell you that its over
But if you look a little closer

I said Leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread

So babe if you know everything tell me why you couldnt see
When I left I wanted you to chase after me

Yeah I said Leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And Ill scream out the window
I cant even look at you
I dont need you but I do I do I do
I say Theres nothing you can say to make this right again
I mean it I mean it
What I mean is

I said Leave but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying was she worth this mess
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess I need you

Just South Of Knowing Why

She didnt have a reason to go oh no
She didnt have a reason to stay
Either way she didnt tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

And time stands still when youre nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs
I just drive on by just south of knowing why

I didnt really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch cos she just felt too much
If you dont know what you want nothings ever enough

And time stands still when youre nowhere bound
Thats where Im headed right now

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs
I just drive on by just south of knowing why

I dont have a plan I dont have a map
I dont even know if Im ever going back
I dont have a when and I dont have a where
I dont even know if Ill know when Im there

But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs
I just drive on by

I just drive on by drive on drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on drive on drive on
Drive all night just south of knowing why

Writing Songs About You

I cant believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why did you have to look so good
Dont you know that Im trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When youre the one who lit it

I cant wait for the day I stop pretending
That Im really ok when Im not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do
Ill keep writing songs about you

Ive got a stack of papers so high
And its all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I cant get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds

I cant wait for the day I stop pretending
That Im really ok when Im not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do
Ill keep writing songs about you

And if you ever change your mind 
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldnt let you in

I cant wait for the day I stop pretending
That Im really ok cause Im not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do

Ill just wait for the day
I stop pretending
That Im really ok when Im not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
Till I do 
Ill keep writing songs about you

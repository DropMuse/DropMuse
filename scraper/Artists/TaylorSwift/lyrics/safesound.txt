Safe &amp; Sound

I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said Ill never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said Dont leave me here alone
But all thats dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
Youll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound

Dont you dare look out your window darling
Everythings on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby
Even when the musics gone
Gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
Youll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
La la la la
La la la la
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
La la la la

Just close your eyes
Youll be alright
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound

Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh

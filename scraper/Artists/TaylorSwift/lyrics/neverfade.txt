Never Fade

I think you fell off of your cloud today
You didnt see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think youre all alone in this place
I think youre crazy cause I still love you baby

Oh dont fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Dont count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Dont fade away
Never fade

Hard to breathe nobody knows its you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask now thats broken too
Everybody else was everything to you

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think everybody wants a fight
I think youre crazy cause I still love you baby

Oh dont fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Dont count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Dont fade away
Never fade

I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know its true
Youve seen the world now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do

Oh dont fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Dont count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Dont fade away
Dont fade away
Dont fade away
Never fade

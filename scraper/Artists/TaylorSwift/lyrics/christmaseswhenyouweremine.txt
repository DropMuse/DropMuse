Christmases When You Were Mine

Please take down the misletoe
Cause I dont wanna think about that right now
Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My mommas in the kitchen worrying about me
Seasons greetings hope youre well
Well Im doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldnt be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

Ive been doing fine without you really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybodys here except you baby
Seems like everyones got someone to hold

But for me its just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas everybody
Thatll have to be something I just say this year
Ill bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands

I know this shouldnt be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didnt wonder how you are tonight
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

You were mine

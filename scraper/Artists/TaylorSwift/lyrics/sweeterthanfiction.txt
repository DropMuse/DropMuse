Sweeter Than Fiction

Hit the ground hit the ground hit the ground oh oh
Only sound only sound that you hear is No
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now youve come undone and I I I I

Seen you fall seen you crawl on your knees eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you wont remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There youll stand ten feet tall
I will say I knew it all along
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction

Just a shot just a shot in the dark oh oh
All you got all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now youre onto something I I I say

What a sight what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
Its like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

There youll stand ten feet tall
I will say I knew it all along
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction

There youll stand next to me
All at once the rest is history
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction fiction

Ill be one of the many saying
Look at you now look at you now now
Ill be one of the many saying
You made us proud you made us proud proud
Ill be one of the many saying
Look at you now look at you now now
Ill be one of the many saying
You made us proud you made us proud proud

And when they call your name
and they put your picture in a frame
You know that Ill be there time and again
Cause I loved you when when you

Hit the ground hit the ground hit the ground oh oh
Only sound only sound that you heard was No
Now in this perfect weather
Its like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever forever

There youll stand ten feet tall
I will say I knew it all along
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction

There youll stand next to me
All at once the rest is history
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction fiction

Its sweeter than fiction
Its sweeter yeah
Its sweeter than sweeter
Sweeter than fiction

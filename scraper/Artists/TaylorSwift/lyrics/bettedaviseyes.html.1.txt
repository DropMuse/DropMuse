Bette Davis Eyes

Her hair is Harlow gold her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold shes got Bette Davis eyes
Shell turn the music on you you wont have to think twice
Shes pure as New York snow she got Bette Davis eyes
And shell tease you shell unease you
All the better just to please you
Shes precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs shes got Bette Davis eyes
Shell let you take her home it whets her appetite
Shell lay you on the throne she got Bette Davis eyes
Shell take a tumble on you roll you like you were dice
Until you come up blue shes got Bette Davis eyes
Shell expose you when she snows you
Hope youll feed with the crumbs she throws you
Shes ferocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think shes a spy shes got Bette Davis eyes
And shell tease you shell unease you
All the better just to please you
Shes precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think shes a spy shes got Bette Davis eyes
Shell tease you shell unease you
Just to please you shes got Bette Davis eyes
Shell expose you when she snows you
She knows you shes got Bette Davis Eyes

That's When

I said I know
He said need some time need some space
To think about all of this
I watched him go
He watched me crushed to the floor
On my knees just like that

He said When can I come back
I said thats when I wake up in the morning
Thats when after sun is always storming
Laughing when Im crying
Thats when Ill be waiting at the front gate
Thats when never see your face
I let you in baby thats when

I said I know
He said I did you wrong made mistakes
Put you through all of this
Cause I let you go you let me think
That Ill be fine without you
Imagine that

So baby Ill come back
I said thats when I wake up in the morning
Thats when after sun is always storming
Laughing when Im crying
Thats when Ill be waiting at the front gate
Thats when Ill never see your face
I let you in baby thats when

And I said all this playing
Did you ever think of me
And he said

Thats when I woke up in the morning
Thats when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I was crying
And thats when we will waiting up to fckin
Thats when I saw your face
To let me in baby thats when

I said I know
He said I need some time need some space

Am I Ready For Love

Sometimes I wonder how its gonna feel
Will my first love be true and real
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall
What will I do when my love comes to call
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Everyday he says darling youre my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart

Will my love come in a bowl of fire
Will it be filled with hope and desire
Will my love come in a pouring rain
Am I ready for the joy am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy am I ready for love

I know Im not a little girl anymore
Cause Im feeling things Ive never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself amp keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other

Will my love come in a bowl of fire
Will it be filled with hope and desire
Will my love come in a pouring rain
Am I ready for the joy am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy am I ready for love

Its a run around the world
And its moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love thats gonna last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand

Will my love come in a bowl of fire
Will it be filled with hope and desire
Will my love come in a pouring rain
Am I ready for the joy am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss am I ready for love

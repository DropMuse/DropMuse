The Best Day

Im five years old
Its getting cold
Ive got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run

Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now  the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
On the way home

I dont know why all the trees change in the fall
I know youre not scared of anything at all
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day
With you today

Im thirteen now
And dont know how my friends
Could be so mean

I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until weve found a town
Far enough away

And we talk and windowshop
Until Ive forgotten all their names

I dont know who Im gonna talk to
Now at school
I know Im laughing on the car ride home with you
Dont know how long its gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
Hes better than I am

I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And youre talking to me

Its the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
Daddys smart
And youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine

And I didnt know if you knew
So Im taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you today

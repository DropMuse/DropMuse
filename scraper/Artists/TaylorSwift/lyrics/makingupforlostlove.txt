Making Up For Lost Love

I need you more than I know how to mention
And Id give forever to get your attention
Be youre summer midnight with starry blue eyes
That only see you and are yours every night
Ooh ooh loves like this
Its something I missed
Ooh ooh loves like this

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
Cussing out all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
Were falling now
And theres nothing we aint too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

All of the days that I couldnt get it right
It all disappeared lying here by your side
With your dirty blue jeans and my crooked smile
You make it look easy changing my life
Ooh ooh loves like this
Its something I missed
Ooh ooh loves like this

Small town daydream
Lasted all night
Cussing out all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
Were falling now
And theres nothing we aint too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

Heaven had quite the time
To figure this life out
But baby Ive got mine
To give you everything you dream about
Ooh ooh loves like this
And its something I dont miss anymore
Ooh ooh loves like this

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
Cussing out all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
Were falling now

Small town daydream
Lasted all night
Cussing out all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
Were falling now
And theres nothing we aint too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

Just two kids making up for lost love

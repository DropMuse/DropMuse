Sweet Escape

If I could be sweet
I would but first of all let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
Cause Ive been acting like sour milk all on the floor
Its your fault you didnt shut the refrigerator
Maybe thats the reason Ive been acting so cold

If I could escape
And recreate a place thats my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldnt that be sweet
If I could be sweet
Sorry but I know Ive been a real bad girl
I didnt mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldnt that be sweet
Sweet escape sweet escape

You let me drown
Im at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on lets bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around
Lets look for some common ground
Oh baby
Times been getting a little crazy
Ive been getting a little lazy
Waiting for you to come save me
I can see that youre angry
By the way that you treat me
Hopefully you dont leave me
Wanna take you with me

If I could escape
And recreate a place thats my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldnt that be sweet
If I could be sweet
Sorry but I know Ive been a real bad girl
I didnt mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldnt that be sweet
Sweet escape sweet escape

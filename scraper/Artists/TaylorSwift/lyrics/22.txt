22

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes uh uh uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh

Yeah
Were happy free confused and lonely at the same time
Its miserable and magical
Oh yeah
Tonights the night when we forget about the deadlines
Its time

Uh oh
I dont know about you
But Im feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You dont know about me
But Ill bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like were

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids uh uh uh uh whos Taylor Swift anyway ew
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

Back To December

Im so glad you made time to see me
Hows life Tell me hows your family
I havent seen them in a while
Youve been good busier than ever
We small talk work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I havent been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leavin
When your birthday passed and I didnt call
And I think about summer all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
Realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was Goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry

Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear Id love you right

Id go back in time and change it but I cant
So if the chain is on your door I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December turn around and make it all right
Id go back to December turn around and change my own mind

I go back to December all the time
All the time

Stand there like a ghost shaking from the rain rain
Shell open up the door and say Are you insane ane
Say its been a long 6 months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want

And thats how it works
Thats how you get the girl
And then you say

I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart Ill put it back together
I would wait forever and ever

And thats how it works
Its how you get the girl girl

With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind uhuh
When you left her all alone and never told her why why

And thats how it works
Thats how you lost the girl
And now you say

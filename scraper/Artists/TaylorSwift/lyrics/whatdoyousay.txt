What Do You Say

What do you say when you just know
That hes the one and you wanna go fast
But hes taking it slow
And what do you do when hes next to you
But hes a little bit shy
Well heres something you can try

Hey hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
Its a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everythings gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say

What do you see when you look in his eyes
Theres something there
That he cant disguise
No matter how he tries
And what do you feel when you know its real
And you cant sit still
If you dont own up will yeah

Hey hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
Its a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everythings gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say

My imaginations running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say

Hey hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
Its a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everythings gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday

What do you say

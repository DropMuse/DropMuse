Welcome Distraction

I got a little thing I call self control
Cause I get a little crazy 
When I let too much go
Loves a little messy and you are too
Right now Im scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasnt gonna stray 
Swore Id never let a man in my way

Youre the last thing I needed today

And I dont know 
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in 
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction welcome distraction

Gone and spilled my coffee 
Tryna get to the phone
Cause it might be you
You just never know
Cant talk to my friends 
Without you coming up
Its even kind of cute 
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down 
A hundred thousand times
Cause it looks so good 
Right next to mine

Youre the last thing I needed tonight

And I dont know 
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in 
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction

Im acting like a girl 
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring 
About anything but you

And I dont know 
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in 
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

Welcome distraction welcome distraction
Welcome distraction welcome distraction oh oh

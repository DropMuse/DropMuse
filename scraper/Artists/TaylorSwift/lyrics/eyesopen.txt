Eyes Open

Everybodys waiting
Everybodys watching
Even when youre sleeping
Keep your eyeyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards winning battles with our wooden swords
But now weve stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open

Everybodys waiting for you to break down
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
Even when youre sleeping sleeping
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open

So here you are two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought youd make it this far
But turn around turn around oh theyve surrounded you
Its a showdown showdown and nobody comes to save you now
But youve got something they dont
Yeah youve got something they dont
Youve just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybodys waiting for you to break down
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
Even when youre sleeping sleeping
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open

Keep your eyes open 4x

Everybodys waiting for you to break down
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
Even when youre sleeping sleeping

Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open

Can I Go With You

Any day now theyre talking war
I can see the look thats in your eyes
Theyre not talking a week or two
Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with you

You pack a suitcase take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think youre gonna be
You say this crazy worlds come undone

Summers over and leaves begin to fall
And another winters on the way
I knew I wasnt gonna take this very well
But Id give anything to have you here today

Everyday now theyre talking war
amp I know this time is like its never been before
Were not talking about a week or two

Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with you

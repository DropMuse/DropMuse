Tell Me

It was something like a perfect start to
This love yesterday but now who are you
I thought I knew
Your eyes how to know to look right through me
Its like you forgot the words you whispered to me
They werent true
Its like it wasnt you

Could you tell me what did I do
Because it cant be were already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me

Take time to realize I know
That people change their minds
But that was something I wished you would say
To my face
But you run away

Could you tell me what did I do
Because it cant be were already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me

If I had a reason or a simple goodbye
Baby even a lie
Yeah Yeah

Tell me what did I do
Because baby suddenly were already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me
And tell me

Ooooh Yeah
Tell me
Tell Me

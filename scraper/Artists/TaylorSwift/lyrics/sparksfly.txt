Sparks Fly

The way you move is like a fullon rainstorm
And Im a house of cards
Youre the kind of reckless
That should send me runnin
But I kinda know that I wont get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldnt see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
Youre a bad idea
You touch me once and its really something
You find Im even better than you imagined I would be
Im on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know its no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Ill run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me its just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Wont you whisper soft and slow
Im captivated by you baby like a firework show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly
Oh baby smile
And the sparks fly

Your Face

I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space in every room
And i know that if i turn around you wont be there
If i close my eyes will you be there

I dont wanna lose your face
And i dont wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i dont wanna turn around
Coz im not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i dont wanna lose your face

Ive got a picture of you in my bedroom
And i hope it never falls
And i hope i never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call
And now i wonder to myself
Who were you and where are you
Were you ever here at all

I dont wanna lose your face
And i dont wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i dont wanna turn around
Coz im not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i dont wanna lose your face

That girl in the song had it so good
I wish i could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And i had you

I dont wanna lose your face
And i dont wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i dont wanna turn around
Coz im not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i dont wanna lose your face

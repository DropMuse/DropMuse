Sad Beautiful Tragic

Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words how little they mean when youre a little too late
I stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
Good girls hopeful theyll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds in different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And youve got your demons and darling they all look like me

Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance timing breakdown fighting
Silence this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me try to fix it could you just try to listen
Hang up give up for the life of us we cant get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic beautiful tragic beautiful

What we had  a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Viva La Vida

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemys eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead Long live the king

One minute I held the keys
Next the doors were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells aringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I cant explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldnt believe what Id become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever wanna be king

I hear Jerusalem bells aringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I cant explain
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

For some reason I cant explain
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

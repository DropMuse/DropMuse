Long Time Coming

I got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing itd be a long time going

They say its better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And I say whoever said that didnt have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasnt how it was supposed to be with me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

Ive burned my bridges had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And Im still not over you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

A long time going

And it will be a long time long time going
Ohoh ohoh oh

It will be a long time long time going going
Ohoh ohoh oh

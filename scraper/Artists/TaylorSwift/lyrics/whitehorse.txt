White Horse

Say youre sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl
I should have known I should have known

Chorus
That Im not a princess this aint a fairy tale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse to come around

Maybe I was na√Øve
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didnt know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

Chorus
That Im not a princess this aint a fairy tale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness begging for me
Just like I always wanted but Im so sorry

Cause Im not your princess this aint a fairytale
Im gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And its too late for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you and your white horse to catch me now

Oh whoa whoa whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh its too late
To catch me now

You Do

Here I am once again
In your driveway thinking I should be leaving
I should go but its so entertaining watching you breathing
You went and got to me like
The stupid song on the radio that you try to forget
But it sticks in your head
So goodbye its not goodnight
Cause Ill be seeing you in my dreamin

Boy you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin so bad spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends tell them all about you
Always looking like a one of those nights
When youre thinkin about a kiss til the morning light
You got me you do

In a daze pull the shades
Close my eyes and picture you at my window
I relax I go back to all the things you said
That only I know

Boy you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin so bad spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my all my friends tell them all about you
Always looking like a one of those nights
When youre thinkin about a kiss til the morning light
You got me you do

I run right out to my car
And I pull out the drive
Its only been ten minutes
But I have to see you one more time

Cause you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin so bad I spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my all my friends tell them all about you
And its looking like a one of those nights
When youre thinkin about a kiss til the morning light
You got me you do
Oh you got me you do

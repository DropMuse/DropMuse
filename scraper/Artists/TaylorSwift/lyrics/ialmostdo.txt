I Almost Do

I bet this time of night youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I dont
I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cause each time you reach out theres no reply
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I cant say Hello to you
And risk another goodbye

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I dont
I almost do
I almost do

Oh we made quite a mess babe
Its probably better off this way
And I confess babe
In my dreams youre touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you
And I almost do

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I dont
I almost do
I almost do

I bet this time of night youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me

Holy Ground

I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord it took me away
Back to a firstglance feeling on New York Time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light Go
Yeah you skipped the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke wed made
And that was the first day

And darling it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the storys got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

Cause darling it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you

It was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you

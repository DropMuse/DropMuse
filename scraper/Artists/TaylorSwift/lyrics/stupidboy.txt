Stupid Boy

Let me know hows it feel
To be under my skin wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere youve been
And everything I do I do it just for you
So why the hell dont you love me
Why the hell dont you need me like I need you
Are you so far above me
Dont you know that theres nothing I wouldnt do
But I was just a toy which you destroyed
Stupid boy

I have been looking in trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt every single time
And then you walk right by Im screaming out inside
Why the hell dont you love me
Why the hell dont you need me like I need you
Are you so far above me
Dont you know that theres nothing I wouldnt do
But I was just a toy which you destroyed
Stupid boy

What happens when you wake up to see that youve lost
You take one look at me cause thats what it cost
I was gonna be everything you need
Cause youre everything to me

So why the hell dont you love me
Why the hell dont you need me like I need you
Are you so far above me
Dont you know that theres nothing I wouldnt do
But I was just a toy which you destroyed
Stupid boy

Let me know hows it feel to be under my skin

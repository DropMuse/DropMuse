If This Was A Movie

Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and Im still reaching
Even though I know youre not there
I was playing back a thousand memories baby
Thinking bout everything weve been through
Maybe Ive been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie youd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now Im pacing down the hall chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Nothings gonna change not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie youd be here by now

If youre out there
If youre somewhere
If youre moving on
Ive been waiting for you
Ever since youve been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door
And Id say

Come back come back come back to me like
You would before you said Its not that easy
Before the fight before I locked you out
But I take it all back now

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie youd be here by now

Youd be here by now
Its not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby what about the ending
Oh I thought youd be here by now whoa
Thought youd be here by now

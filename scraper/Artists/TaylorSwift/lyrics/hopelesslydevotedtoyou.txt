Hopelessly Devoted To You

Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
Im not the first to know
Theres just no getting over you

You know Im just a fool whos willing
To sit around and wait for you
But baby cant you see
Theres nothing else for me to do
Im hopelessly devoted to you

But now theres nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
Im out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

My head is saying Fool forget him
My heart is saying Dont let go
Hold on till the end
And thats what I intend to do
Im hopelessly devoted to you

But now theres nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
Im out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

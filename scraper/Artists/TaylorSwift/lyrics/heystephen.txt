Hey Stephen

Hey Stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked
We were talking 
I didnt say half the things I wanted to

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Ill be the one waiting there even when its cold
Hey Stephen
Boy you might have me believing
I dont always have to be alone

Chorus
Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself

Hey Stephen
Ive been holding back this feeling
So Ive got some things to say to you ha
I seen it all 
So I thought 
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do

The way you walk way you talk way you say my name 
Its beautiful wonderful dont you ever change
Hey Stephen
Why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same

Chorus

Theyre dimming the street lights
Youre perfect for me why arent you here tonight
Im waiting alone now so come on and come out and pull me near to shine shine shine

Hey Stephen
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls 
Well theyre beautiful
But would they write a song for you

Chorus
I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself
if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself

Myself
Cant help myself
I cant help myself

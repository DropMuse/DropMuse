Didn't They

She walks to school with her arms crossed
Its just another day
At 10 oclock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
Its scary how things change

And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

Didnt she call you
Didnt she need you bad enough
Was there some reason Im not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didnt she pray too

He kissed his wife good bye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle three men walked and said
Were here to die for our God
He stood up and said Thats funny
Cause my God died for me

I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

Didnt he call you
Didnt he need you bad enough
Was there some reason Im not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didnt he pray too

The taxis pulled up on the very day of
They rode 100 floors up just to come back down
They never thought theyd see the day
That the towers up in flames
There was nothing left to say when it all came down

And didnt they call you
Didnt they need you bad enough
Was there some reason Im not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you Where were you
And didnt they pray too

I walk to school and I wear a cross
Im counting every day

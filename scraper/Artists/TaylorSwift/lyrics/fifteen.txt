Fifteen

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Its the morning of your very first day
You say Hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybodys way
Its your freshman year and youre gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I havent seen you around before

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen
Feeling like theres nothing to figure out
Well count to ten take it in
This is life before you know who youre gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough youre best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think theyre so cool
Well be out of here as soon as we can
And then youre on your very first date and hes got a car
And youre feeling like flying
And your mammas waiting up and youre thinking hes the one
And youre dancing round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
When youre fifteen
And your first kiss makes your head spin round
But in your life youll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team
But I didnt know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen
Dont forget to look before you fall
Ive found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who youre supposed to be
I didnt know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

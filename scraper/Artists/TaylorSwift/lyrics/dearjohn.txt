Dear John

Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor wont fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young
To be messed with
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home I shouldve known

Well maybe its me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe its you and your sick need
To give love then take it away

And youll add my name to your long list of traitors who dont understand
And Ill look back in regret how I ignored when they said
Run as fast as you can

Dear John I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young
To be messed with
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

Dear John I see it all now it was wrong
Dont you think nineteens too young
To be played by your dark twisted games
When I loved you so I shouldve known

You are an expert at Sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that youve run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Cause youve burned them out

But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So dont look now
Im shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

Dear John I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young
To be messed with
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young
To be messed with
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song you shouldve known

You shouldve known
Dont you think I was too young
You shouldve known

Stay Stay Stay

Im pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turnaway
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
Thats when you came in wearing a football helmet and said Okay lets talk

And I said
Stay stay stay
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay

Before you Id only dated selfindulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now Im always laughin
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay stay stay
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears my hopes and dreams
I just like hangin out with you all the time
All those times that you didnt leave
Its been occurring to me Id like to hang out with you for my whole life

Stay
And Ill be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad mad mad
So I think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay stay stay

Stay stay stay
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay stay stay

Stay stay stay
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay

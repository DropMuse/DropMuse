Clean

The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
Youre still all over me like a winestained dress I cant wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war and the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
Thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
Thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean
Said I think I am finally clean

10 months sober I must admit
Just because youre clean dont mean you dont miss it
10 months older I wont give in
Now that Im clean Im never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
Thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
Thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
Finally clean
Think Im finally clean
Think Im finally clean

Nashville

On a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well its quite not London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chance

Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe Im a fast train
Blowin through a valley
Watching all my life go by

Youre a distant memory
Youre an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I cant confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress

Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe Im a fast train
Blowing through a mountain
Watching all my life go by

Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
Whats the use of wondering why
Maybe Im a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July

And its safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you

Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe Im a fast train
Blowing though a valley
Tearing up a good July

Im going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
Whats the use of wondering why
Maybe Im a storm front
Blowing through the valley
Tearing up a good July

Going back to Nashville

Im going back to Nashville

Going back to Naaaaahh

Going back to Nashville
Whats the use of wondering why

Ain't Nothing 'Bout You

The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
Its a perfect passion and I cant get enough

The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
The way you kiss The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
Theres aint nothing bout you there aint nothing bout you
That dont do something for me

wahooahoo

In my life Ive been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby its no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
The way you kiss The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There aint nothing bout you there aint nothing bout you
That dont do something for me

I love your attitude your rose tattoo your every thought
Your smile you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
The way you kiss The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There aint nothing bout you there aint nothing bout you
That dont do something for me

The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance your drive You make me feel alive

The way you talk the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me

Love Story

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there on a balcony in summer air

See the lights see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you Please dont go
And I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all thats left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say Yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh oh

Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you Please dont go
And I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all thats left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say Yes

Romeo save me Theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but its real
Dont be afraid well make it out of this mess
Its a love story baby just say Yes

Oh oh oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said

Romeo save me Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me Juliet youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad  go pick out a white dress
Its a love story baby just say Yes

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Cause we were both young when I first saw you

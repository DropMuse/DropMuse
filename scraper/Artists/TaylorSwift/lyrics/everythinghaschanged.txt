Everything Has Changed

Taylor Swift
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now know something now I didnt before
And all Ive seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like

Taylor Swift
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now

Both
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you know you know you

Both
Cause all I know is we said Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

Ed Sheeran
And all my walls stood tall painted blue
And Ill take them down take them down and open up the door for you

And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind making up for lost time
Album version Taking flight making me feel right
Remix version Taking flight making me feel right like

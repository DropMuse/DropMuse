I Know Places

You stand with your hand on my waist line
Its a scene and were out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
Its a bad sign bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Loves a fragile little flame it could burn out
It could burn out 

Cause they got the cages they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run

Baby I know places we wont be found 
And theyll be chasing their tails tryin to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places I know places

Lights flash and well run for the fences
Let them say what they want we wont hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time 

Just grab my hand and dont ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run

Baby I know places we wont be found 
And theyll be chasing their tails tryin to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places 

They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and dont ever drop it
My love

Baby I know places we wont be found 
And theyll be chasing their tails tryin to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots but were bulletproof
I know places
And you know for me its always you
I know places
In the dead of night your eyes so green
I know places
And I know for you its always me
I know places

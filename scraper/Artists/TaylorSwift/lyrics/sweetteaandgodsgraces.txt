Sweet Tea And God's Graces

Tire swings summer dreams honeysuckle on the breeze
Whistle County creek
Laying in the green grass I was watching clouds pass
Baby you were watching me
Cold barn struck bed everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and Gods graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothings shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And thats what I learned from you

Autumn rain window pane looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh your ghost your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But Im a little smarter my hearts a little harder
But its still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times

I remember

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and Gods graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothings shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And thats what I learned from you

Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was
Hey how have you been
You caught me with that old smile
Said Its really been a while
And I still think about back when

We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothings shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now Im someone new
And thats what I learned from you

Oh thats what I learned from you
Thats what I learned from you oh you oh
Thats what I learned from you oh yeah

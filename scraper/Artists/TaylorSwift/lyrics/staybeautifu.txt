Stay Beautiful

Corys eyes are like a jungle
He smiles its like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
Theres pretty girls on every corner
That watch him as hes walking home
Saying Does he know
Will you ever know

Chorus
Youre beautiful
Every little piece love
And dont you know
Youre really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life lead you back to my door
Oh but if it dont
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
Im taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
Its hard to make a conversation
When hes taking my breath away
I should say hey by the way

Chorus

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
Ill never get to hold
At least youll know

Youre beautiful
Every little piece love
And dont you know
Youre really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life lead you back to my front door
Oh but if it dont
Will you stay
Beautiful beautiful beautiful
Beautiful beautiful beautiful
La la la
Oh oh oh oh
Oh but if it dont
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na na na na na

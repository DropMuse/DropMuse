Superman

Tall dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
Its the same thing to me
Hes got his mothers eyes his fathers ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say yay
And you smile and say How are you 
I say Just fine
I always forget to tell you I love you I love you forever

I watch superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
Go save the world Ill be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back Ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall dark and beautiful
Hes complicated hes irrational
But I hope someday youll take me away and save the day yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin
Hes not all bad like his reputation
And I cant hear one single word they say
And youll leave got places to be and Ill be OK
I always forget to tell you I love you I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
Go save the world Ill be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back Ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you dont save some other girl
Dont forget dont forget about me
Im far away but I never let you go
Im lovestruck and looking out the window
Dont forget dont forget where Ill be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
Go save the world Ill be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear Ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down

La la la la la la
La la la la la la

When you come back down

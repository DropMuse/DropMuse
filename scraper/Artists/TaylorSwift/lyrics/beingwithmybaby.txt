Being With My Baby

All is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddys car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mamas wondering where we are
Its just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what Ive found

Ooh lifes so sweet right here
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
Ooh just wanna stay right here
Cause nothings quite like being with my baby

Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and Im home too late
We didnt take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh I cant leave yet

Ooh lifes so sweet right here
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
Ooh just wanna stay right here
Cause nothings quite like being with my baby

Look at what weve found
So turn that car around

Ooh lifes so sweet right here
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
Ooh just wanna stay right here
Ooh hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby my baby

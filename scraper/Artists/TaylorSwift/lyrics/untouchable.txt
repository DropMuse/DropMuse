Untouchable

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky Mmmm
Im reaching out and I just cant tell you why
Im caught up in you Im caught up in you
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And when youre close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on come on
Say that well be together
Come on come on
Little taste of Heaven

Its half full and I wont wait here all day
I know youre saying that youll be here anyway
But youre untouchable
Burning brighter than the sun
Now that youre close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on come on
Say that well be together
Come on come on

Oh In the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on come on
Say that well be together
Come on come on
Little taste of Heaven

Oh oh Im caught up in you
Oh oh oh
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And when youre close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on come on
Say that well be together
Come on come on oh oh

Oh Oh In the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on come on
Say that well be together
Come on come on
Little taste of Heaven

Like a million little stars spelling out your name
Spelling out your name

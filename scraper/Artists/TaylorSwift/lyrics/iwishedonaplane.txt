I Wished On A Plane

Throwing pennies at the fountain 
When youre standing on a mountain 
Its kinda hard to aim 

But like the trees we cut our names in 
There must be an explanation 
Guess it didnt given off rain 
I need reasons why youre leaving 

Chorus
Well I guess I wished on a plane 
I thought was a star 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasnt really from your heart 
Couldve sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought was a star 

Diving off into the deep end 
Honestly believe youd be there 
When I jumped in 
Is aint your territory 
We had the perfect love story 
except ending 
Nothing comes true 
When it comes to you 

Chorus
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought was a star 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasnt really from your heart 
Couldve sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought it was a star 

And I was too cloudy 
Its not my fault I just couldnt see 

Chorus
Well I guess I wished on a plane 
I thought it was a star 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasnt really in your heart
Couldve sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought it was a star 

Throwing pennies at the fountain 
When youre standing on a mountain 
Its kinda hard to aim

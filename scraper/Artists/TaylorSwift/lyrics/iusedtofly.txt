I Used To Fly

I I used to fly
Didnt matter where Id been
Cause Id seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry

I know you cant see me here
But I am not alone
Im lying here in invisible arms
And I wont be alone tonight

You you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please dont leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light

I know you cant see me here
But I am not alone
Im lying here in invisible arms
And I wont be alone tonight

Oh let me think Im strong
Please dont bring me down
I need you tonight

I know you cant see me here
But I am not alone
Im lying here in invisible arms
And I wont be alone tonight

I I used to fly
Didnt matter where Id been
Cause Id seen the sky

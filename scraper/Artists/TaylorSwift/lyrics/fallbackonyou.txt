Fall Back On You

Isnt it funny how many times we can say
We drawn the line cross it out turn the page
And moved on
Thats what we thought

But here I am in the same old car
Having myself another same old browneyed bar
Uh oh uh oh

I wont tell nobody
I wont tell my friends
Well just drive down this road till the one were on ends
And well tell each other things like I need you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

You always let someone come in between
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

I wont tell nobody
I wont tell my friend
Well just drive down this road and pray it doesnt end
And well tell each other things like I love you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people who you come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

Maybe well last
Maybe we wont
Maybe well stop talking and Ill haunt you like a ghost
But just baby get along with me

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people that you come back too
Fall back on me
Baby Ill fall back on you
Fall back on me baby
Baby Ill fall back on you
Fall back on you

Fall back on you

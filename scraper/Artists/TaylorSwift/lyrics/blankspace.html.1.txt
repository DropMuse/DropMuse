Blank Space

Nice to meet you where you been
I could show you incredible things
Magic madness heaven sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Loves a game wanna play

New money suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Aint it funny rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey lets be friends
Im dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So its gonna be forever
Or its gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when its over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

Cause were young and were reckless
Well take this way too far
Itll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
But Ive got a blank space baby
And Ill write your name

Cherry lips crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses pretty lies
Youre the King baby Im your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come oh no

Screaming crying perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
Oh my God who is she
I get drunk on jealousy
But youll come back each time you leave
Cause darling Im a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So its gonna be forever
Or its gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when its over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

Cause were young and were reckless
Well take this way too far
Itll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
But Ive got a blank space baby
And Ill write your name

Boys only want love if its torture
Dont say I didnt say I didnt warn ya
Boys only want love if its torture
Dont say I didnt say I didnt warn ya

So its gonna be forever
Or its gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when its over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

Cause were young and were reckless
Well take this way too far
Itll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
But Ive got a blank space baby
And Ill write your name

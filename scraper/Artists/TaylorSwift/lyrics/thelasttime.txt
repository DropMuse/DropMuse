The Last Time

Gary Lightbody
I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
Im not sure how I got there
All roadsthey lead me here

I imagine you are home
In your room all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

Both
and right before your eyes
Im breaking no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye

Taylor Swift
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave

And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

Both
and right before your eyes
Im aching no past
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye

Taylor Swift This is the last time you tell me Ive got it wrong
Gary Lightbody This is the last time I say its been you all along
Taylor Swift This is the last time I let you in my door
Gary Lightbody This is the last time I wont hurt you anymore

Oh oh oh

This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

4x
This is the last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this

Don't Hate Me For Loving You

My momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
Wed never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said

Dont walk away now
And dont rip my heart out
Dont you block me out tonight
Honey where are you
And dont hate me for loving you

He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew 
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I wanna do is say

Dont walk away now
And dont rip my heart out
Dont you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And dont hate me for loving you

I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there
Do you even care
To cross above my head
But someone said

Dont turn away now
And dont rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know its right for you
And dont hate me for loving you

I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eye

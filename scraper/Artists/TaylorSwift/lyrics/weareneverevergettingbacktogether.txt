We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying This is it Ive had enough cause like
We hadnt seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space What
Then you come around again and say
Baby I miss you and I swear Im gonna change trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day
I say I hate you we break up you call me I love you

Ooh we called it off again last night
But ooh this time Im telling you Im telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like ever

Im really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that Im right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record thats much cooler than mine

Ooh you called me up again tonight
But ooh this time Im telling you Im telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh yeah ooh yeah ooh yeah
Oh oh oh

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say Never say never
Uggg so he calls me up and hes like I still love you
And Im like I just I mean this is exhausting you know like
We are never getting back together Like ever

No

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

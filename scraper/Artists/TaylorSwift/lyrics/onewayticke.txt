One Way Ticket

Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
Theres a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
Im heading out tonight traveling light
Im gonna start all over again

And buy a oneway ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause Im gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I dont know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that Im strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I wont let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

And buy a oneway ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause Im gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I dont know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that Im strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Well I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

Buy a oneway ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause Im gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I dont know

Buy a oneway ticket on a west bound train
Im gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain gonna do everything

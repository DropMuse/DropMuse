Come Back... Be Here

You said it in a simple way
4 AM the second day
How strange that I dont know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself Dont get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in New York today
I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I cant put this down
If I had known what Id known now
I never would have played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I cant help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in London today
I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away

New York be here
But youre in London and I break down
Cause its not fair that youre not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in New York today
And I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here

I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here
Come back be here

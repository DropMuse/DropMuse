Who I've Always Been

You walk in here with your guitar man
Your shining boots and your full on band
A smile on your face a knife in your hand
Singing songs youve got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

But dont ruin yourself I aint your competition
Dont flatter yourself that was never my intention

I wanna talk about what you are that I aint
Lets talk about what you do that I cant
Lets talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Lets talk about what you did to get here
Lets talk about blood and sweat and tears
Lets talk about what you want to be and who Ive always been

I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar Ive always played
And the words i wrote down on a page
When i was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd youre paying dues
I tell them this is what I do
And its what i put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

And say life on musical road is rough conditions
But the easy ride was never my ambition

I wanna talk about what you are that I aint
Lets talk about what you do that I cant
Lets talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Lets talk about what you did to get here
Lets talk about blood and sweat and tears
Lets talk about what you want to be and who Ive always been

Lets talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen I was on this stage
So wheres that crown gotten you these days
When its me and you and the same damn games

So what have you got that I aint
And what can you do that I cant
Lets put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Lets talk about what you did to get here
Lets talk about blood and sweat and tears
Lets talk about what you wanna be girl and who Ive always been

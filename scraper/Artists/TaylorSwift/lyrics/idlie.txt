I'd Lie

I dont think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
Hell never fall in love he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
Im laughing cause I hope hes wrong
And I dont think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs
And

Chorus
I could tell you his favorite colors green
He loves to argue born on the seventeenth
His sisters beautiful he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
Id lie

He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldnt a light go on
Doesnt he know that Ive had him memorized for so long
He sees everything black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I dont let nobody see me wishing he was mine

Chorus

He stands there then walks away
My god if I could only say
Im holding every breath for you

Hed never tell you but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is My god hes beautiful
So I put on my makeup
And pray for a miracle

Yes I could tell you his favorite colors green
He loves to argue oh and it kills me
His sisters beautiful he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
Id lie

Breathe

I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But its killing me to see you go after all this time

Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

Music starts playin like the end of a sad movie
Its the kinda ending you dont really wanna see
Cause its tragedy and itll only bring you down
Now I dont know what to be without you around

And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I cant breathe without you
But I have to
Breathe without you
But I have to

Never wanted this never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
People are people and sometimes it doesnt work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I cant breathe without you
But I have to
Breathe without you
But I have to

Its two AM
Feelin like I just lost a friend
Hope you know its not easy easy for me
Its two AM
Feelin like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this aint easy easy for me

And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me

Ohhh

And I cant breathe without you
But I have to
Breathe without you
But I have to
Breathe without you
But I have to

Im sorry oh
Im sorry mmm
Im sorry eh eh
Im sorry mmm
Im sorry eh eh
Im sorry mmm
Im sorry

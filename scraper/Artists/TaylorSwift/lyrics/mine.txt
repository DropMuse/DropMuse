Mine

Uh oh oh
Uh oh oh

You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left a small town never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say Can you believe it
As were lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes yes I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

Flash forward and were taking on the world together
And theres a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded
You say well never make my parents mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes yes this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

Oh oh oh oh

And I remember that fight
Twothirty AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the Goodbye
Cause thats all Ive ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said Ill never leave you alone

You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you its like the first time
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter
She is the best thing thats ever been mine

Hold on make it last
Hold on never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

Hold on do you believe it
Hold on were gonna make it now
Hold on and I can see it
Yes yes I can see it now see it now see it now

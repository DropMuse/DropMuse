Spinning Around

Days go by I wonder if you here me
Cant you read between the lines
Now Im standing still I am disappearing 
Take this chance Ill make you mine

Dont you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But loves got me cornered in the back of the room
Im spinning around Im spinning around
And all I see is someone I dont know
Loves got me tangled tired me too
No sign of a wall sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

He tells lies are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Dont ask how but fate decides

Dont you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But loves got me cornered in the back of the room
Im spinning around Im spinning around
And all I see is someone I dont know
Loves got me tangled tired me too
No sign of a wall sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl youve got to make it

But loves got me cornered in the back of the room
Im spinning around Im spinning around
And all I see is someone I dont know
Loves got me tangled tired me too
No sign of a wall sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And all I see is you

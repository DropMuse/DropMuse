Matches

I shined your shoes
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time

I patched your dance smile
That your friends
Which apparently is a crime

I gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to her

But lifes too long
To waste it all loving a liar

And when love hands me matches now
Im gonna burn it down

I keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn song

Look what youve found
Shes been around
I hear the lines long

And dont you tell me
To be nice
Im not a nice girl

She died from complications
Of the things you told her

So when love hands me matches now
Im gonna burn it down

Aint it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck
Well i say cheater liar truck on fire loser leaver deceiver
Just a few Ive thought of

And when love hands me matches now
Gonna burn it down
Im gonna burn it down
Oh yeah
Gonna burn it burn it burn it down

Matches now

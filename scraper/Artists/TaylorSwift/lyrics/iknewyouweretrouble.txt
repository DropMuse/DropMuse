I Knew You Were Trouble

Music video spoken part
I thinkI think when its all over
It just comes back in flashes you know
Its like a kaleidoscope of memories
It just all comes back But he never does
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen
Its not really anything he said or anything he did
It was the feeling that came along with it
And the crazy thing is I dont know if Im ever gonna feel that way again
But I dont know if I should
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright
But I just thought how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you
Maybe he knew that when he saw me
I guess I just lost my balance
I think that the worst part of it all wasnt losing him
It was losing me

Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights you got me alone
You found me you found me you found me
I guess you didnt care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me without me without me

And hes long gone when hes next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble

No apologies Hell never see you cry
Pretends he doesnt know that hes the reason why
Youre drowning youre drowning youre drowning
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all Ill ever be
And now I see now I see now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in you were right there you were right there
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble

I dont know if you know who you are until you lose who you are

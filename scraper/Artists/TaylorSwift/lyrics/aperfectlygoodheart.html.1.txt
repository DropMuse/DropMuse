A Perfectly Good Heart

Chorus 1
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apartnow
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

Maybe I shouldve seen the signs shouldve read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say I still cant believe
That you would walk away
It dont make sense to me but

Repeat Chorus 1
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

Its not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before

Chorus 2
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apartnow
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break would you wanna break a

Repeat Chorus 1
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

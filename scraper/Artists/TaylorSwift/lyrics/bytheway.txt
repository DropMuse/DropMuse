By The Way

I had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room
Holding her hand
Id have never guessed
That starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
Well pick up where we left off

And by the way
Your eyes are dancing
Id say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My hearts still breaking
Its gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way

I shouldve let you know
All the ways you made me feel alive
I guess its too late
So Ill just get my coat
And make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe youll drop what youre doing
And come over here to say 
Im looking good

But by the way
Your eyes are dancing
Id say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My hearts still breaking
Its gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say

By the way
You still look amazing
And I mustve been crazy to let you get away
By the way
If you ever wondered
Still got the same old number just in case
I still miss you
And i still love you
By the way
By the way oh

My Cure

I know weve got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But Id be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better

All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

If you leave Ill be crawling back for more
if you need love Ill be standing at your door
Ill be sick inside if baby youd be my cure

wherever you think I am tonight 
just know were miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye 
Ill be right where you are baby

sometime along the way you take my breath away
distracted by he view
I fall right into you

and if you ever leave Ill be crawling back for more
and if you ever need love Ill be standing at your door
Ill be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

they say I need to see all the people out there waiting
but you take one look at me
and I know the mistake Id be making

cuz if you ever leave Ill be crawling back for more
and if you ever need love Im standing at your door
Ill be sick inside if baby you be my cure

I know weve got a lot to say between now and forever

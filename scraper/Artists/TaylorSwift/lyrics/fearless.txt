Fearless

Theres somethin bout the way
The street looks when its just rained
Theres a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh yeah

Were drivin down the road
I wonder if you know
Im tryin so hard not to get caught up now
But youre just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin me want you

And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So baby drive slow
Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passengers seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it

Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
Im not usually this way
But you pull me in and Im a little more brave
Its the first kiss
Its flawless
Really something
Its fearless

Oh yeah

Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Ohoh
Oh yeah

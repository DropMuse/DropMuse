Invisible

She cant see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
Shell never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

And you cant see me wantin you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

Chorus
I just wanna show you
She dont even know you
Shes never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Theres a fire inside of you
That cant help but shine through
Shes never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

Chorus

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh were invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize

I just wanna show you
She dont even know you
Baby let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

She cant see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile

You Belong With Me

Youre on the phone with your girlfriend
Shes upset shes going off about something that you said
Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do

Im in the room its a typical Tuesday night
Im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like
And shell never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts
I wear tshirts
Shes cheer captain
And Im on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see
That Im the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why cant you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I cant help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey isnt this easy

And youve got a smile
That could light up this whole town
I havent seen it in a while
Since she brought you down

You say youre fine I know you better than that
Hey what you doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
Shes cheer captain
And Im on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see
That Im the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why cant you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

Instrumental

Oh I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
Im the one who makes you laugh
When you know youre bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know its with me

Cant you see
That Im the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why cant you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

Better Than Revenge

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did

Ha
Time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along got him alone and lets hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage

I never saw it coming wouldnt have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

Shes not a saint
And shes not what you think
Shes an actress whoa
Shes better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress whoa
Soon shes gonna find
Stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like its a party and shes on the list
She looks at me like Im a trend and shes so over it
I think her everpresent frown is a little troubling
And she thinks Im psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isnt what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They wouldnt teach you that in prep school so its up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

Shes not a saint
And shes not what you think
Shes an actress whoa
Shes better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress whoa
Soon shes gonna find
Stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Im just another thing for you
To roll your eyes at honey
You might have him but havent you heard
Im just another thing for you
To roll your eyes at honey
You might have him but I always get the last word
Whoa

Shes not a saint
And shes not what you think
Shes an actress whoa
Shes better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress whoa
Soon shes gonna find
Stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what youre doing
Cause I dont think you do Oh
Do you still feel like you know what youre doing
I dont think you do
I dont think you do
Lets hear the applause
Come on show me how much better you are so much better yeah
So you deserve some applause cause youre so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage

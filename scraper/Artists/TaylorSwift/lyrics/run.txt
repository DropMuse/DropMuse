Run

Theres a plane or a bus leaving Dallas
I hope youre on it
If theres a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it
Cause I swear out there aint where
You outta be
So catch a ride or catch a cab
Dont you know that I miss you bad
But dont you walk to me

Baby run cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You cant get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run
So baby run

Oh if you aint got a suitcase
Get a box
Or an old brown paper sack
Pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck take a Chevy
Baby just come back
Theres a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why dont you take it
Dont let that speed limit slow you down
Go on and break it
Baby break it

Baby run
Cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You cant get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run

Run to me
Baby run
Run to me
So baby run
Run
Oh baby run

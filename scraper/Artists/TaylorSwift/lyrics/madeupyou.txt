Made Up You

Your feet under the table
I love it when theyre touching mine
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

You smile just like a picture
It doesnt even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what Ive got

Do you know when you go 
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

Id never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never couldve dreamed you up this good

Oh oh

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

Made Up You

Oh oh

Made Up You

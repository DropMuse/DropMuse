You're Not Sorry

All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
Ive been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And its taken me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And youre thinking well be fine again
But not this time around

You dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby
Like I did before
Youre not sorry no no oh

Looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didnt know
Couldve loved you all my life
If you hadnt left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And Im tired of being last to know
And now youre asking me to listen
Cause its worked each time before

But you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby
Like I did before
Youre not sorry no no oh

Youre not sorry no no oh

You had me crying for you honey
And it never wouldve gone away no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Theres nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby
Like I did before
Youre not sorry no no oh

Youre not sorry no no oh

Your Anything

I bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if youll ever find
Just what you want
A hometown number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or thats what you thought
But heres what youve got

Chorus
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
Ill be your angel giving up her wings
If thats what you need
Id give everything to be your anything

If you want hard to get
If you want
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either onell be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes

Chorus

Its not like Im giving up who I am for you
but for someone like you its just so easy to do

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
Ill be your angel giving up her wings
If thats what you need

If thats what you need

Chorus

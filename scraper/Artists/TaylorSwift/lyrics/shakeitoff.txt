Shake It Off

I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
Thats what people say mmmmmm
Thats what people say mmmmmm

I go on too many dates chuckle
But I cant make them stay
At least thats what people say mmmmmm
Thats what people say mmmmmm

But I keep cruising
Cant stop wont stop moving
Its like I got this music
In my mind
Saying Its gonna be alright

Cause the players gonna play play play play play
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
I shake it off I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break break break break break
And the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
I shake it off I shake it off

I never miss a beat
Im lightning on my feet
And thats what they dont see mmmmmm
Thats what they dont see mmmmmm

Im dancing on my own dancing on my own
I make the moves up as I go moves up as I go
And thats what they dont know mmmmmm
Thats what they dont know mmmmmm

But I keep cruising
Cant stop wont stop grooving
Its like I got this music
In my mind
Saying Its gonna be alright

Cause the players gonna play play play play play
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
I shake it off I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break break break break break
And the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake

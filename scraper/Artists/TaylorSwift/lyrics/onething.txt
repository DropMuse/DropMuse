One Thing

It wasnt just like a movie
The rain didnt soak through my clothes down to my skin
Im driving away and I I guess you could say
This is the last time Ill drive this way again
When theres nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I I still love you but I cant

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but its coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me yeah

The picture frame is empty
Its black and white youre smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
I was so sure of everything we thought wed always have
Im lost in the sound of it
But here in the now comes in
Seems like Im becoming part of your past

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but its coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

And theres so much that I cant touch
Youre all I want but its not enough this time
And I can feel you like your slipping through my hands
And Im so scared of how this ends

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but its coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but its coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me yeah yeah
There was one thing I knew would never leave me

It wasnt just like a movie
The rain didnt soak through my clothes down to my skin

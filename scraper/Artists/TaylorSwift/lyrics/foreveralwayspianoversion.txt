Forever &amp; Always (Piano Version)

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down we almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now youre half way out the door

And I stare at the phone
He still hasnt called
And then you feel so low
You cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here
And it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore

And I stare at the phone
He still hasnt called
And then you feel so low
You cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here
And it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didnt mean it baby
I dont think so oh oh oh
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything

Back up baby back up
Please back up oh back up
Back up baby back up

Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here
And it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said forever and always

And I stare at the phone
He still hasnt called
And then you feel so low
You cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When we said forever and always
Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here
And it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didnt mean it baby
You said forever and always yeah

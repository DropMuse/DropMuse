Tell Me Why

I took a chance I took a shot 
And you might think im bulletproof but im not 
You took a swing I took it hard 
And down here from the ground I see who you are 

Im sick and tired of your attitude 
Im feeling like I dont know you 
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when youre around 
And heres to you and your temper 
Yes I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what youre doing to me 
Tell me why 

You could write a book on how to ruin someones perfect day 
Well I get so confused and frustrated 
Forget what im trying to say oh 

Im sick and tired of your reasons 
I got no one to believe in 
You tell me that you want me then push me around 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when youre around 
Heres to you and your temper 
Yes I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what youre doing to me 
Tell me why 

Whydo you have to make me feel small 
So you can feel whole inside 
Whydo you have to put down my dreams 
So youre the only thing on my mind 

Im sick and tired of your attitude 
Im feeling like I dont know you 
You tell me that you want me then cut me down 
Im sick and tired of your reasons 
Ive got no one to believe in 
You ask me for my love then you push me around 
Heres to you and your temper 
Yes I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what youre doing to me 
Tell me why 
Why tell me why 

I take a step back let you go 
I told you im not bulletproof 
Now you know

Brought Up That Way

Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddys hand
He says Baby girl whats wrong with you
She says Please dont make me go back there again

She said I wish there was some way
To make them stop it
So he drives down to
That principles office and says

I didnt bring her up
So they could cut her down
I didnt bring her here
So they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life
To see that little girls smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face
She wasnt brought up that way

Emilys home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh but somethings different this time
She doesnt have too much to say
She said He tried but theres just some things I wont do
And through the tears she said I couldnt do that to you
And he said

I didnt bring you up
So he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart
And turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life
To see my little girls smile
So dont let nobody take that away
You werent brought up that way

The phone rings on a rainy night
Says Its officer Tate
He said Sir theres been an accident
You better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an over pass
And Emily  shes fading fast

He says God I didnt bring her up
To watch them lay her down
Nearly killed me the day
They put her momma in the ground
Only thing that kept me alive
Was that little girls smile
So please dont take that away
It wont be easy taking her today
She wasnt brought up that way

He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes

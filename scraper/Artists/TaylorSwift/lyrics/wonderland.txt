Wonderland

Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole

You held on tight to me
Cause nothings as it seems
Im spinning out of control

Didnt they tell us dont rush into things
Didnt you flash your green eyes at me
Havent you heard what becomes of curious minds

Oh

Didnt it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh 5x
In wonderland
Eh 5x
In wonderland
Eh 5x
In wonderland
Eh 5x
In wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed

But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Oh

Didnt they tell us dont rush into things
Didnt you flash your green eyes at me
Didnt you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile

Oh

Didnt it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
Its all fun and games til somebody loses their mind

But darling we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh 5x
In wonderland
Eh 5x
In wonderland
Eh 5x
In wonderland
Eh 5x
In wonderland

I reached for you but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You search the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad

Oh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever last forever
Eh eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better never better
Eh eh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it wonderland
And we pretended it could last forever in wonderland

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it wonderland
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderland

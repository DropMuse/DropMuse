Tied Together With A Smile

Seems the only one who doesnt see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking youre not pretty
But thats not true cause I know you

Chorus
Hold on baby youre losing it
The waters high youre jumping into it
And letting go and no one knows
That you cry but you dont tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone

I guess its true that love was all you wanted
Cause youre giving it away like its extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh cause its not his price to pay
Not his price to pay

Chorus x2

Youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone oh
Goodbye baby
With a smile baby baby

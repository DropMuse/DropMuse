Wildest Dreams

He said Lets get out of this town
Drive out of the city away from the crowds
I thought heaven cant help me now
Nothing lasts forever but this is gonna take me down

Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say youll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams ahha ohh
Wildest dreams ahha ohh

I said No one has to know what we do 
His hands are in my hair his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now

Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad but he does it so well
And when weve had our very last kiss
My last request it is

Say youll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams ahha ohh
Wildest dreams ahha ohh

You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

Youll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

Say youll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just pretend

Say youll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your just pretend just pretend
Wildest dreams ahha ohh
In your wildest dreams ahha ohh
Even if its just in your wildest dreams ahha
In your wildest dreams ahha

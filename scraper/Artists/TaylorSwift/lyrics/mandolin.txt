Mandolin

Hes got a nice little life
Hes gonna live it but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red and he said
Its not the best I know
But its mine Im gonna make it mine

People there cant help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Whos getting by from their applause
Hes got a song that moves along
Hes got his local crowd tonight
At Angelinas family bar and grill

Hes got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Whos that guy who plays the mandolin mandolin
Oh yeah mandolin

Got a car got a scar
Like everyone hes got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars yeah

Hes got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Whos that guy who plays the mandolin mandolin
Oh yeah mandolin

Oh hes the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth

Hes got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Whos that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh Im the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh mandolin

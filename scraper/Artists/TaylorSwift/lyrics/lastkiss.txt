Last Kiss

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 158
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now Ill go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I dont know how to be something you miss
I never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party youre showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
Im not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
Theres not a day I dont miss those rude interruptions

And Ill go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I dont know how to be something you miss
Never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips

So Ill watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope its nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And its a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So Ill go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I dont know how to be something you miss
Never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last

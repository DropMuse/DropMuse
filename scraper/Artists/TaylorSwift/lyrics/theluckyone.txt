The Lucky One

New to town with a made up name in the angels city
Chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream

You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights like diamonds in the sky

And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now youre the lucky one oh oh oh

Now its big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that youre lucky
But youre so confused
Cause you dont feel pretty you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights You wonder if youll make it out alive

And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Can you tell me now youre the lucky one oh oh oh

It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
And it took some time but I understand it now

Cause now my name is up in lights but I think you got it right

Let me tell you now youre the lucky one
Let me tell you now youre the lucky one
Let me tell you now youre the lucky one oh oh oh

Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh

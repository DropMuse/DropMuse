Crazier

Id never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
Til you open the door
Theres so much more
Id never seen it before
I was trying to fly
But I couldnt find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

Chorus
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like Im falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier crazier crazier

Ive watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldnt see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe

Chorus

Baby you showed me what living is for
I dont wanna hide anymore
Oh oh

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like Im fallin and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier crazier crazier
Crazier crazier

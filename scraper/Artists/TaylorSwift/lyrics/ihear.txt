I Heart ?

Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But its something i just fell into 

And it was overrated
But just look what ive created
I came out alive but im black and blueue

Before you ask me if im alright 
Think about what i 
Had to dooo yeah

Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart put on my makeup
Another mess i didnt plan 
And ill bet you thought youd beat me 
Wish you could only see 
Ive got an i heart question mark 
Written on the back of my hand

Id be fine if you just walked by 
But you had to talk about why 
You were wrong and i was right 

But i cant believe you made me 
Sit at home and cry like a baby 
Wait right by the phone every night 

And now you ask about you and i 
Theres no you and i 
Remember what you put me through 
I had to 

Wake up and smell the breakup 
Fix my heart put on my makeup 
Another mess i didnt plan 
And ill bet you thought youd beat me
I wish youd could only see
I got an i heart question mark 
Written on the back of my hand 

And when youre home alone at night 
Youll still wonder 
Why you took everything i had oh baby
I had a lot about you and i 
Theres no you and i 
And i know 
Someday you will

Wake up and smell the breakup 
Realize that we wont makeup
It didnt go the way you planed 

And youll know you didnt beat me 
When you look down and see 
Ive got an i heart question mark 
Written on the back of my hand 

Written on the back of my hand
An i heart question mark yeah
Written on the back of my hand

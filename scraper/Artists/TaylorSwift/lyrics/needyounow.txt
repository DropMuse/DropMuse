Need You Now

I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came

My worlds a little colder now
But Im keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
Whos gonna hold you
I dont need you dont need you now

I need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a oneway street

You need me now
Thats what youve been telling my friends
That Ive come too far to go back there again

My heart my mind and number have changed
You might as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need you dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
Whos gonna hold you
I dont need you dont need you now

I need you now
Red letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need you dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
So whos gonna hold you
I dont need you now
And I dont know where you are
I dont wonder where you are
I dont dream about you cause I dont need you now

I dont dream about the way
That I never heard you say
I need you I need you
I dont need you now

Dont need you
Dont need you now

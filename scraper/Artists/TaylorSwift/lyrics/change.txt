Change

And its a sad picture
The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again
And you know its all the same
Another time and place
Repeating history and youre getting sick of it

But I believe in whatever you do
And Ill do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah

So weve been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
Its hard to fight when the fight aint fair
Were getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But were faster and never scared

You can walk away say we dont need this
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this

Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah

Tonight well stand get off our knees
Fight for what weve worked for all these years
And the battle was long its the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
This revolution throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And well sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

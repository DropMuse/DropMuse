Cross My Heart

Ive been counting days and
Ive been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above
I dont want to jinx my luck
Ive left it all behind me
And Ive been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Dreaming of you baby
Ive been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
Cause Ive been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you

I dont want to jinx my luck
Ive left it all behind me
And Ive been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if youve seen one
Id like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

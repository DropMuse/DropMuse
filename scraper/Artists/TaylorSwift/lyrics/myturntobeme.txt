My Turn To Be Me

Something about me didnt fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I havent read it a thousand times

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

To talk walk think stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time Im flying free
Its my turn to be me

You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
Shell still sing the same old songs

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

To talk walk think stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time Im flying free
Its my turn to be me

Turned on that radio
Hey thats when I realized
It wasnt our song it was yours
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than

To talk walk think stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time Im flying free
Its my turn to be me

Its my turn to be me

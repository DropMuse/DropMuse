Ours

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here wed laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs

Seems like theres always someone who disapproves
Theyll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jurys out but my choice is you

So dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high the waters rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I dont care cause right now youre mine

And youll say
Dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high the waters rough
But this love is ours

And its not theirs to speculate
If its wrong and
Your hands are tough
But they are where mine belong and
Ill fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
Cause my heart is yours

So dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they cant take whats ours
They cant take whats ours

The stakes are high the waters rough
But this love is ours

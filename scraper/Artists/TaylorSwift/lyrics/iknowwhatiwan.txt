I Know What I Want

I like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream

I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see

Dont try me
Dont fight me
You be you and Ill be me

They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you

Your mum and daddys walls
Are covered up in pictures of you

You never met a mirror
That you didnt look again into

So sorry dont worry
Im sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do

They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you
And it aint you oh

Oh baby dont persuade me
I know that you aint used to no
So let me say it real slow

They say Ive always known
What I wanted its true
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I get what I want

And they say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
And youll will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you

I Want You Back

Oh baby give me one more chance
Ill show you that I love you
I want you please let me
Back in your heart

Oh darling I was blind to let you go
Let you go baby
Now that I see you in her arms

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

I want you back ohh baby

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

Oh baby give me one more chance
Ill show you that I love you
I want you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
Let you go baby
Now that I see you in her arms

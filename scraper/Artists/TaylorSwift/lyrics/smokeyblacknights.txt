Smokey Black Nights

Lets watch
The tide chase
The waves
Onto the sand
I wonder
If a broken heart
Feel the warmth
On my hand
And I wonder
What a piece
Of driftwood
Has seen all through
His lifetime
Lets walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

Ive seen
A million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want
To speak to you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
Theres nothing
Id rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

Still throught
The haze
I can make out
Constellations
Ill make one
Of you and me
As we sit
In the sand
And I saw
That sunset gleamin
As my eyes went wild
Lets walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

Ive played
A thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want
To sing to you

Waited on a wire
Starin at the fire
Theres nothing
Id rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

Ive walked
A thousand miles
Smiled
A thousand smiles
Now I only smile
When Im with you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
Theres nothing
Id rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

So walk with me
As the sweet
Wind dances
Ill write a song
For you and me
On the
Smokey black nights

Better Off

I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet there was never a doubt
That we wont forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this  our first kiss

All my friends are saying 
Girl what are you thinking
Youre better off 
youre better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl that boy is trouble
Youre better off youre better off
They can talk forever they just dont know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like were flying
Dont wanna come down
But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause youre gone

All my friends are saying
Girl why are you crying
Youre better off youre better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl that boy is trouble
Youre better off youre better off
They can talk forever they just dont know better

You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we dont have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We dont have to do things their way

All my friends are saying
Girl what are you thinking
Youre better off youre better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl that boy is trouble
Youre better off youre better off
Well they can talk forever they just dont know better

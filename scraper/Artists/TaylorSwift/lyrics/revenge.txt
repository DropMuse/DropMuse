Revenge

I couldve keyed your car
I couldve rolled your yard
I know the passwords to your emails everything you do
I couldve put em to good use

But Im dressed to kill and tonight Im going out on a date
With your best friend he always liked me anyway

REVENGE My list of things to do this week
Jealousy misery gonna give you what you gave to me
Make you feel so BAD
Break you make you sorry
I hope you cry getting my REVENGE

So Im gonna paint the town with him
Replace your memory everywhere weve ever been
I dont hangout at smokey bars but I know well see you there
And Im making you hear me laugh like I just dont care

I know you hate my friends so tonight I called em all
Later on you can expect some prank phone calls baby

REVENGE My list of things to do this week

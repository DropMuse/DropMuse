Teardrops On My Guitar

Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he wont see
That I want and Im needing everything that we should be
Ill bet shes beautiful that girl he talks about
And shes got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me I laugh cause its just so funny radio version
Drew talks to me I laugh cause its so damn funny CD version
That I cant even see anyone when hes with me
He says hes so in love hes finally got it right
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night

Chorus
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing dont know why I do

Drew walks by me can he tell that I cant breathe
And there he goes so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause

Chorus

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
Ill put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

Cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one whos got enough of me to break my heart
Hes the song in the car I keep singing dont know why I do
Hes the time taken up but theres never enough
And hes all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he wont see

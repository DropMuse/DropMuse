Christmas Must Be Something More

What if ribbons and bows didnt mean a thing
Would the song still survive without five golden rings
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
What would happen if God never let it snow
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie
Tell me what would you find

Youd see that today holds something special
Something holy not superficial
So heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives
Its something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So heres something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do
What if happiness came in a cardboard box
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away
Tell me what would you find

Youd see that today holds something special
Something holy not superficial
So heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives
Its something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So heres something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred mile an hour lives
And its this time of year
And everybodys here
It seems the last thing on your mind

Is that the day holds something special
Something holy not superficial
So heres to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
Its something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But heres something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more

Theres gotta be more
Theres gotta be more

Forever &amp; Always

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye
And told me you loved me

Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect now youre half way out the door

And I stare at the phone
He still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
Made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure

So heres to everything
Coming down to nothing
Heres to silence
That cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore

And I stare at the phone
He still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didnt mean it baby
I dont think so

Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything

Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Oh I stare at the phone
He still hasnt called
And then you feel so low
You cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didnt mean it baby
You said forever and always yeah

Baby, Don't You Break My Heart Slow

I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken
Do you mean
Do you mean what you say
When you say our love could last forever

Well Id rather you be mean
Than love and lie
Id rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
Id rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby dont you break my heart slow

I like the way youd hold me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way youd sing to me
Every time the things got rocky yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken
Do you say
Do you say what you mean
When you say our love could last forever

Well Id rather you be mean
Than love and lie
Id rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
Id rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby dont you break my heart slow

Oh yeah yeah

Youd run around
And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking were together
I want our love to last forever

But Id rather you be mean
Than love and lie
Id rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
And Id rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby dont you break my heart slow
Now baby dont you break my heart
Slow

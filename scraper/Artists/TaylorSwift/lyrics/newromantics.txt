New Romantics

Were all bored were all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just arent coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me mine is better

Were so young but were on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what were doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a classroom

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby were the new romantics
Come on come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

Were all here the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back its all in the timing
Its poker he cant see it in my face
But Im about to play my Ace

We need love but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey most of them are true

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby were the new romantics
Come on come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
Its so romantic

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby were the new romantics
Come on come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

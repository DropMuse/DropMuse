Riptide

I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh all my friends are turning green
Youre the magicians assistant in their dreams

Oh and they come unstuck

Lady running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when youre singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
Youre gonna sing the words wrong

Theres this movie that I think youll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboys running from himself
And shes been living on the highest shelf

Oh and they come unstuck

Lady running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when youre singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
Youre gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna I just wanna know
If youre gonna if youre gonna stay
I just gotta I just gotta know
I cant have it I cant have it any other way
I swear shes destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that youve ever seen oh

Lady running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when youre singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
Youre gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when youre singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
Youre gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when youre singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
Youre gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat because youre gonna sing the words wrong

Come In With The Rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I dont wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I dont wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name
Just know Im right here hopin
That youll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I dont wanna have to go that far
And I Ive got you down
I know you by heart
And you dont even know where I start

Talk to yourself talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And dont wait for the sky to clear

Ill leave my window open
Cus Im too tired at night to call your name
Oh just know Im right here hopin
That youll come in with the rain

Ive watched you so long
Screamed your name
I dont know what else I can say

But Ill leave my window open
Cus Im too tired at night for all these games
Just know Im right here hopin
That youll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I dont wanna go there anymore

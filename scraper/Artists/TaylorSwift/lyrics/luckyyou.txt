Lucky You

Theres a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever never say never
You could do better thats what she says

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite
Of the fact that shes different
And yet shes the same
And she says lucky you lucky you

She sings her little song she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travels lives they unravel
Mind over matter thats what she says

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite
Of the fact that shes different
And yet shes the same
And she says lucky you lucky you lucky you

Maybe shell sing you do do do do
Maybe shell bring you into the skies
Honey shell love you funny how some view
Angels above you aint so far away

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite
Of the fact that shes different
And yet shes the same
And she says lucky you lucky you

Breathless

Here you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought youd want to know

That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
Ill never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you wont go again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
Ill never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

Im so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that youve found you even
Missed yourself
Im only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh youll never go again
Again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
Ill never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless

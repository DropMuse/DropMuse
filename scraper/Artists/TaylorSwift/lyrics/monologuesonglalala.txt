Monologue Song (La La La)

I like glitter and sparkly dresses
But Im not gonna talk about that
In my monologue
I like baking and things that smell like winter
But Im not gonna talk about that
In my monologue

La la la la la la

I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me
But Im not gonna say that
In my monologue
I like writing their names into songs so theyre ashamed to go in public
But Im not gonna say that
In my monologue

La la la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might think Id bring up Joe
The guy who broke up with me on the phone
But Im not gonna mention him
In my monologue
Hey Joe Im doing real well
Tonight Im hosting SNL
But Im not gonna brag about that
In my monologue

La la la ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
La la la

And if youre wondering if I might
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight
Hi Taylor
Im not gonna comment on that
In my monologue

La la la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue

But theres nothing more to say
Cause everythings okay
Ive got security lining this stage
This is my SNL monologue

La la la la la la la
This is my SNL monologue
La la la la la la la
That was my SNL monologue

The Diary Of Me

Im a laid back
Tshirt blue jean mood ring
Kinda girl
Hey yeah whats the word on you
Lay low Im a mission rebel
Angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental

But here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

Im poetry complicated
Simply stated
Hey yeah baby how about you
I was born free
Im a cell phone hippie
Are you with me
When I mess up I dont get up
I just get down yeah

But here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

Its raining on Sunday
Theres nothing on TV
Yesterday was lonely
Youre the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I cant stop thinking about you
I bet youre thinking of me too

Well here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

Picture To Burn

State the obvious I didnt get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that Im obsessive and crazy
Album version line Thats fine Ill tell mine that youre gay
Music video version line Thats fine you wont mind if I say
By the way

Chorus
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak
Whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned youre
Just another picture to burn

Theres no time for tears
Im just sitting here planning my revenge
Theres nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddys gonna show you how sorry youll be

Chorus

And if youre missing me
Youd better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health

Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak
Whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you havent heard
I really really hate that

Chorus

Burn burn burn baby burn
Youre just another picture to burn
Baby burn

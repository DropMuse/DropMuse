Last Christmas

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well its been a year it doesnt surprise me
Merry Christmas I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you I meant it
Now I know what a fool Ive been
But if you kiss me now I know youd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special

A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
Im hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year Ill give it to someone special

Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It wont be anything like anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special

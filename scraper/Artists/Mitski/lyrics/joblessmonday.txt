Jobless Monday

Its a windy afternoon
Cant afford to buy my food
Or the drive I need to go
Further than they said Id go

He only loves me when
Theres a means he means to end
Oh I miss when we first met
He didnt know me yet

So take me out baby
Makes no difference where well be
As long as were out in the sun
Take me out baby

Take me out baby
Doesnt matter where well be
But please under the light of day
Take me out
Take me out
Take me out baby

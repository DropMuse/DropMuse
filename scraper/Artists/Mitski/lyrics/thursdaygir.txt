Mitski
Thursday Girl

Glory glory glory to the night that shows me what I am
As I go to the party on my knees
Saying take it all please

And tell me no
Tell me no tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody please
Tell me no tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no

Glory glory glory to the night
It shows me what I am
Im not happy or sad just up or down
And always bad

And tell me no
Tell me no tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody please
Tell me no tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody here
Tell me no tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no

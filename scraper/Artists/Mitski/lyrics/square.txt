Mitski
Square

Your room was square
I once noticed from there
In your bed as you slept
And I held my breath
Everything had its own place
And I wondered what space would I take
In the order you kept

I tried to eat like your girlfriend
Just tea in the night Id end up
Too hungry to sleep
So lying awake I would follow the aching inside
I would find
Its for you wont be mine

I tried my hardest for Id never learned
Gods very simple and love shouldnt burn
And I wouldve offered you all that you yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn

What is that quiet of snow in the night
The dark rings with white noise
As you stand and drown
Maybe its all of these snowflakes screaming
A choir of mute
As they brace for the ground

Well thats my ride
Hope you had a good night
You know you made me happy
Here shake my hand
You make such a good man
Never once did you know me

I tried my hardest for Id never learned
Gods very simple and love doesnt burn
And maybe you offered me all that I yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn

Silly me waiting

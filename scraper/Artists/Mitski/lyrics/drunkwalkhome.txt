Mitski
Drunk Walk Home

I will retire to the salton sea
At the age of 23
For Im starting to learn I may never be free
But though I may never be free
Fuck you and your money
Im tired of your money

And I sit on the curb cause its the prettiest night
With no one else in sight
You know I wore this dress for you
These killer heels for you
See the dark it moves
With every breath of the breeze

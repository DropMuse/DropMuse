Dan The Dancer

Dan had very long limbs
From leading day to day
Lean onto a cliff
That stretched him everyday
And when shed ask to hold hands
He would smile and
Let one of his hands go
His whole life in one hand
His whole life

When hed say goodnight and
Leave her doorstep
Hed use his last strength
To wave back
And once back in his room
Once back in his room
Hed return his waving hand
Back to its cliff
He liked it more than life itself
Im sure

Cause Dan had never danced outside of his room
When no one was home and he would stop to hear the door
So when he moved with you
And felt his body let go
Of course you couldnt know
It was you and you alone
That he had shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
He would never tell you that it was his first time

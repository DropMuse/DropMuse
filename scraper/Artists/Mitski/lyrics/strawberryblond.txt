Mitski
Strawberry Blond

I love everybody
Because I love you
When you stood up
Walked away barefoot
And the grass where you lay
Left a bed in your shape
I looked over it
And I ached

I love everybody
Because I love you
I dont need the city and I
Dont need proof
All I need darling
Is a life in your shape
I picture it soft
And I ache

Look at you strawberry blond

Reach out the car window
Trying to hold the wind
You tell me you love her
I give you a grin
Oh all I ever wanted was a
Life in your shape
So I follow the white lines
Follow the while lines
Keep my eyes on the road
As I ache

Look at you strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

Isaiah Isaiah Isaiah Isaiah Isaiah Isaiah

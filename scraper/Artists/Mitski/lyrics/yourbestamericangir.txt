Mitski
Your Best American Girl

If I could Id be your little spoon
And kiss your fingers forevermore
But big spoon you have so much to do
And I have nothing ahead of me
Youre the sun youve never seen the night
But you hear its song from the morning birds
Well Im not the moon Im not even a star
But awake at night Ill be singing to the birds

Dont wait for me I cant come

Your mother wouldnt approve of how my mother raised me
But I do I think I do
And youre an allAmerican boy
I guess I couldnt help trying to be your best American girl

Youre the one
Youre all I ever wanted
I think Ill regret this

Your mother wouldnt approve of how my mother raised me
But I do I finally do
And youre an allAmerican boy
I guess I couldnt help trying to be the best American girl
Your mother wouldnt approve of how my mother raised me
But I do I think do

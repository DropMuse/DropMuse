Francis Forever

I dont know what to do without you
I dont know where to put my hands
Ive been trying to lay my head down
Im writing this at 3am

I dont need the world to see
That Ive been the best I can be but
I dont think I could stand to be
Where you dont see me

On sunny days I go out walking
I end up on a treelined street
I look up at the gaps of sunlight
I miss you more than anything

I dont need the world to see
That Ive been the best I can be but
I dont think I could stand to be
Where you dont see me

And autumn comes when youre not yet done
With the summer passing by but
I dont think I could stand to be
Where you dont see me

Mitski
A Burning Hill

Today I will wear my white buttondown
Im tired of wanting more
I think Im finally worn
For you have a way of promising things
And Ive been a forest fire
I am a forest fire
And I am the fire and I am the forest
And I am a witness watching it
I stand in a valley watching it
And you are not there at all

So today I will wear my white buttondown
I can at least be neat
Walk out and be seen as clean
And Ill go to work and Ill go to sleep
And Ill love the littler things
Ill love some littler things

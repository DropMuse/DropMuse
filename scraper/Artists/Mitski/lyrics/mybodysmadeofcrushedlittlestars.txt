Mitski
My Body's Made Of Crushed Little Stars

Im not doing anything
Im not doing anything
My bodys made of crushed little stars
And Im not doing anything
I wanna see the whole world
I wanna see the whole world
I dont know how Im gonna pay rent
I wanna see the whole world

Would you kill me Jerusalem
Kill me Jerusalem
Kill me Jerusalem
Come find me

I better ace that interview
I better ace that interview
I should tell them that Im not afraid to die
I better ace that interview

Uh
I work better under a deadline
I work better under a deadline
I pick an age when Im gonna disappear
Until then I can try again
Until then I can try again

Kill me Jerusalem
Kill me Jerusalem
Kill me Jerusalem
Go and kill me

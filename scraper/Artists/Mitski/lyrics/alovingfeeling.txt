A Loving Feeling

What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when youre all alone

Holding hands under the table
Meeting up in your bedroom
Making love to other people
Telling each other its all good
Kisses like pink cotton candy
Talking to everyone but me
Im staying up late just in case you come up and ask to leave with me

What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when youre all alone
What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when youre all alone

You only love me when were all alone

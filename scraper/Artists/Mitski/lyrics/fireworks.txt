Mitski
Fireworks

One morning this sadness will fossilize
And I will forget how to cry
Ill keep going to work and you wont see a change
Save perhaps a slight gray in my eye

I will go jogging routinely
Calmly and rhythmically run
And when I find that a knifes sticking out of my side
Ill pull it out without questioning why

And then one warm summer night
Ill hear fireworks outside
And Ill listen to the memories as they cry cry cry

I will be married to silence
The gentleman wont say a word
But you know oh you know in the quiet he holds
Runs a river that will never find home

And then one warm summer night
Ill hear fireworks outside
And Ill listen to the memories as they cry cry cry
Oh one warm summer
Ill hear fireworks outside
And Ill listen to the memories as they cry cry cry
Cry cry cry
Cry cry cry

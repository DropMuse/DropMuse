I Bet On Losing Dogs

My baby my baby
Youre my baby say it to me
Baby my baby
Tell your baby that Im your baby

I bet on losing dogs
I know theyre losing and I pay for my place
By the ring
Where Ill be looking in their eyes when theyre down
Ill be there on their side
Im losing by their side

Will you let me baby
Lose on losing dogs
I know theyre losing and I pay for my place
By the ring
Where Ill be looking in their eyes when theyre down

I wanna feel it
I bet on losing dogs
I always want you when Im finally fine

How youd be over me looking in my eyes when I cum
Someone to watch me die
Someone to watch me die
I bet on losing dogs

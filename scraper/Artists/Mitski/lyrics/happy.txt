Happy

Happy came to visit me he bought cookies on the way
I poured him tea and he told me itll all be okay
Well I told him Id do anything to have him stay with me
So he laid me down and I felt happy come inside of me
He laid me down and I felt happy

Oh if youre going take the train
So I can hear it rumble one last rumble
And when you go take this heart
Ill make no more use of it when theres no more you

I was in the bathroom I didnt hear him leave
I locked the door behind him and I turned around to see
All the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
Well I sighed and mumbled to myself again I have to clean
I sighed and mumbled to myself

If youre going take the train
So I can hear it rumble one last rumble
And when you go take this heart
Ill make no more use of it when theres no more you
And if youre going take the moon
Then maybe I will see you in the night Ill see you
And when you go take this heart
Ill make no more use of it when theres no more you
